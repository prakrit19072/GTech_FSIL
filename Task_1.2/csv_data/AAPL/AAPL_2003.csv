Business Strategy 

The Company is committed to bringing the best personal computing and music experience to students, educators, creative professionals, businesses, government agencies, and consumers through its innovative hardware, software, peripherals, services, and Internet offerings. The Company&#146;s business strategy leverages its unique ability, through the design and development of its own operating system, hardware, and many software applications and technologies, to bring to its customers new products and solutions with superior ease-of-use, seamless integration, and innovative industrial design. The Company believes continual investment in research and development is critical to facilitate innovation of new and improved products and technologies. Besides updates to its existing line of personal computers and related software, services, peripherals, and networking solutions, the Company continues to capitalize on the convergence of digital consumer electronics and the computer by creating innovations like the iPod and iTunes Music Store. The Company&#146;s strategy also includes expanding its distribution network to effectively reach more of its targeted customers and provide them a high-quality sales and after-sales support experience. 

Digital Hub 

The Company believes personal computing is in an era in which the personal computer functions for both professionals and consumers as the digital hub for advanced new digital devices such as the Company&#146;s 

iPod digital music players, personal digital assistants, cellular phones, digital camcorders and still cameras, CD and DVD players, televisions, and other consumer electronic devices. The attributes of the personal computer include a high quality user interface, relatively inexpensive data storage, and the ability to run complex applications and easily connect to the Internet. Apple is the only company in the personal computer industry that controls the design and development of the entire personal computer&#151;from the hardware and operating system to sophisticated applications. Additionally, the Company&#146;s products provide innovative industrial design, intuitive ease-of-use, and built-in networking, graphics and multimedia capabilities. Thus, the Company is uniquely positioned to offer integrated digital hub products and solutions. 

The Company develops products and technologies that adhere to many industry standards in order to provide an optimized user experience through interoperability with peripherals and devices from other companies. The Company has played a role in the development, enhancement, promotion, and/or use of numerous of these industry standards. 

Expanded Distribution 

The Company believes that a high quality buying experience with knowledgeable salespersons who can convey the value of the Company&#146;s products and services is critical to attracting and retaining customers. The Company sells many of its products and resells certain third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, education customers, and businesses through its retail and online stores in the U.S. and internationally. The Company has also invested in programs to enhance reseller sales, including the Apple Sales Consultant Program, which consists of the deployment of Apple employees and contractors to selected third-party reseller locations. The Company believes providing direct contact with its targeted customers is an efficient way to demonstrate the advantages of its Macintosh computer and other products over those of its competitors. The Company has significantly increased the points of distribution for the iPod product family in order to make its products available at locations where its customers shop. 

From inception of the retail initiative in 2001 through 2005, the Company had opened 116 retail stores in the U.S. and 8 international stores in Canada, Japan, and the U.K. The Company opened 2 additional stores in October 2005. The Company has typically located its stores at high traffic locations in quality shopping malls and urban shopping districts. 

One of the goals of the retail initiative is to bring new customers to the Company and expand its installed base through sales to computer users who currently do not own a Macintosh computer and first time personal computer buyers. By operating its own stores and building them in desirable high traffic locations, the Company is able to better control the customer retail experience and attract new customers. The stores are designed to simplify and enhance the presentation and marketing of personal computing products. To that end, retail store configurations have evolved into various sizes in order to accommodate market demands. The stores employ experienced and knowledgeable personnel who provide product advice and certain hardware support services. The stores offer a wide selection of third-party hardware, software, and various other computing products and supplies selected to complement the Company&#146;s own products.

The AppleCare Protection Plan is a fee-based service that typically includes three years of phone support and hardware repairs, dedicated web-based support resources, and user diagnostic tools. 

Markets and Distribution 

The Company&#146;s customers are primarily in the education, creative, consumer, and business markets. The Company distributes its products through wholesalers, resellers, national and regional retailers and 

cataloguers. No individual customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales in 2005, 2004, or 2003. The Company also sells many of its products and resells certain third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, education customers, and businesses through its retail and online stores in the U.S. and internationally. Over 12% of the Company&#146;s net sales in 2005 were through its U.S. education channel, including sales to elementary and secondary schools, higher education institutions, and individual customers. 

Competition 

The Company is confronted by aggressive competition in all areas of its business. The market for personal computers and related software and peripheral products is highly competitive. This market continues to be characterized by rapid technological advances in both hardware and software that have substantially increased the capabilities and use of personal computers and have resulted in the frequent introduction of new products with competitive price, feature, and performance characteristics. Over the past several years, price competition in the market for personal computers has been particularly intense. The Company&#146;s competitors who sell personal computers based on other operating systems have aggressively cut prices and lowered their product margins to gain or maintain market share. The Company&#146;s results of operations and financial condition can be adversely affected by these and other industry-wide downward pressures on gross margins. 

The principal competitive factors in the market for personal computers include price, relative price/performance, product quality and reliability, design innovation, availability of software, product features, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, availability of hardware peripherals, and corporate reputation. Further, as the personal computer industry and its customers place more reliance on the Internet, an increasing number of Internet devices that are smaller, simpler, and less expensive than traditional personal computers may compete for market share with the Company&#146;s existing products. 

The Company is currently taking and will continue to take steps to respond to the competitive pressures being placed on its personal computer sales as a result of innovations from competing platforms. The Company&#146;s future operating results and financial condition are substantially dependent on its ability to continue to develop improvements to the Macintosh platform in order to maintain perceived functional and design advantages over competing platforms. 

The Company&#146;s services and products relating to music and other creative content have already encouraged significant competition from other companies, many of whom have greater financial, marketing, and manufacturing resources than those of the Company. The Company faces increasing competition from other companies promoting their own digital music products and distribution services, subscription services, and free peer-to-peer music services. The Company anticipates that competition will intensify as hardware, software, and content providers work more collaboratively to offer integrated products competing with the Company&#146;s offerings. However, the Company believes it currently maintains a competitive advantage by more effectively integrating an entire solution, including the hardware (iPod), software (iTunes), and distribution of third-party digital content (iTunes Music Store). 

Raw Materials 

Although most components essential to the Company&#146;s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain key components (including microprocessors and application-specific integrated circuits (&#147;ASICs&#148;)) are currently obtained by the Company from single or limited sources. Some other key components, while currently available to the Company from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide availability constraints and pricing pressures. In addition, the Company uses some components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer and consumer electronics industries, and new products introduced by the Company often initially utilize custom components 

obtained from only one source until the Company has evaluated whether there is a need for, and subsequently qualifies, additional suppliers. If the supply of a key or single-sourced component to the Company were to be delayed or curtailed or in the event a key manufacturing vendor delays shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company&#146;s ability to ship related products in desired quantities and in a timely manner could be adversely affected. The Company did experience such delays during 2004 and 2005 related to PowerPC G5 processors, which resulted in the constrained availability of certain products. The Company&#146;s business and financial performance could also be adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability of these components may be affected if producers were to decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company&#146;s requirements. In June 2005, the Company announced its intention to transition its Macintosh computers using the PowerPC G5 and G4 microprocessors, which are currently single-sourced, to Intel microprocessors by the end of calendar year 2007. The announcement of this transition may impact the continued availability on acceptable terms of certain components and services, including PowerPC G5 and G4 microprocessors. The Company attempts to mitigate these potential risks by working closely with these and other key suppliers on product introduction plans, strategic inventories, coordinated product introductions, and internal and external manufacturing schedules and levels. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of formal purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. The Company&#146;s purchase commitments typically cover its requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. 

The Company believes there are several component suppliers and manufacturing vendors whose loss to the Company could have a material adverse effect upon the Company&#146;s business and financial position. At this time, such vendors include Agere Systems, Inc., Ambit Microsystems Corporation, ASUSTeK Corporation, ATI Technologies, Inc., Broadcom Corporation, Cypress Semiconductor Corporation, Freescale Semiconductor, Inc., Hitachi Global Storage Technologies, Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd., IBM Corporation, Intel Corporation, International Display Technology, Inventec Appliances Corporation, LG. Phillips Co., Ltd., Matsushita, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, NVIDIA Corp., PortalPlayer, Inc., Quanta Computer, Inc., Samsung Electronics, Synaptics, Inc., and Toshiba Corporation. 

Research and Development 

Because the personal computer and consumer electronics industries are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company&#146;s ability to compete successfully is heavily dependent upon its ability to ensure a continuing and timely flow of competitive products and technology to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new products and technologies and to enhance existing products in the areas of hardware and peripherals, consumer electronic products, system software, applications software, networking and communications software and solutions, and the Internet. The Company may expand the range of its product offerings and intellectual property through licensing and/or acquisition of third-party business and technology. The Company&#146;s research and development expenditures totaled $534 million, $489 million, and $471 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. 

Patents, Trademarks, Copyrights and Licenses 

The Company currently holds rights to patents and copyrights relating to certain aspects of its computer systems, iPods, peripherals and software. In addition, the Company has registered, and/or has applied to register, trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and a number of foreign countries for &#147;Apple,&#148; the Apple logo, &#147;Macintosh,&#148; &#147;iPod,&#148; &#147;iTunes,&#148; &#147;iTunes Music Store,&#148; and numerous other trademarks and service marks. Although the Company believes the ownership of such patents, copyrights, trademarks and service marks is an important factor in its business and that its success does depend in part on the 

ownership thereof, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence, and marketing abilities of its personnel. 

Many of the Company&#146;s products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third-parties. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products and business methods, the Company believes that, based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms; however, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained at all. Because of technological changes in the computer industry, current extensive patent coverage, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible certain components of the Company&#146;s products and business methods may unknowingly infringe existing patents of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third-parties. 

Foreign and Domestic Operations and Geographic Data 

The U.S. represents the Company&#146;s largest geographic marketplace. Approximately 60% of the Company&#146;s net sales in 2005 came from sales to customers inside the U.S. Final assembly of products sold by the Company is conducted in the Company&#146;s manufacturing facility in Cork, Ireland, and by external vendors in Fremont, California, Fullerton, California, Taiwan, Korea, the People&#146;s Republic of China, and the Czech Republic. Currently, manufacture of many of the components used in the Company&#146;s products and final assembly of substantially all of the Company&#146;s portable products including PowerBooks, iBooks, and iPods are performed by third-party vendors in China. Margins on sales of the Company&#146;s products in foreign countries, and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations, including tariffs and antidumping penalties. 

Information regarding financial data by geographic segment is set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements at Note 11, &#147;Segment Information and Geographic Data.&#148; 

Seasonal Business 

The Company has historically experienced increased net sales in its first and fourth fiscal quarters compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due to seasonal demand related to the holiday season and the beginning of the school year. This historical pattern should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Company&#146;s future net sales or financial performance. 

Warranty 

The Company offers a basic limited parts and labor warranty on its hardware products. The basic warranty period for hardware products is typically one year from the date of purchase by the end-user. The Company also offers a 90-day basic warranty for its service parts used to repair the Company&#146;s hardware products. In addition, consumers may purchase extended service coverage on most of the Company&#146;s hardware products in all of its major markets. 

Backlog 

In the Company&#146;s experience, the actual amount of product backlog at any particular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business prospects. In particular, backlog often increases in anticipation of or immediately following new product introductions because of over-ordering by dealers anticipating shortages. Backlog often is reduced once dealers and customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply. Because of the foregoing, backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Company&#146;s ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance. 

Environmental Laws 

Compliance with federal, state, local, and foreign laws enacted for the protection of the environment has to date had no material effect on the Company&#146;s capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. In the future, these laws could have a material adverse effect on the Company. 

Production and marketing of products in certain states and countries may subject the Company to environmental and other regulations including, in some instances, the requirement that the Company provide consumers with the ability to return to the Company product at the end of its useful life, and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the Company. Such laws and regulations have recently been passed in several jurisdictions in which the Company operates, including various European Union member states, Japan, and California. In the future, these laws could have a material adverse effect on the Company. 

Employees 

As of September 24, 2005, the Company had approximately 14,800 full-time equivalent employees and an additional 2,020 temporary employees and contractors. 

Available Information 

The Company&#146;s Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to reports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, are available on its website at http://www.apple.com/investor when such reports are available on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website.

7A," Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

Interest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management 

The Company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and its interest rate swap and option positions, both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures. However, given the effective horizons of the Company&#146;s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures, there can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates. In addition, the timing of the accounting for recognition of gains and losses related to mark-to-market instruments for any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Company&#146;s operating results and financial position. 

Interest Rate Risk 

While the Company is exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world&#146;s leading industrialized countries, the Company&#146;s interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of U.S. interest rates. In this regard, changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company&#146;s cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments as well as costs associated with foreign currency hedges. 

The Company&#146;s short-term investment policy and strategy is to ensure the preservation of capital, meet liquidity requirements, and optimize return in light of the current credit and interest rate environment. The Company benchmarks its performance by utilizing external money managers to manage a small portion of the aggregate investment portfolio. The external managers adhere to the Company&#146;s investment policies and also provide occasional research and market information that supplements internal research used to make credit decisions in the investment process. 

The Company&#146;s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company&#146;s investment portfolio. The Company places its short-term investments in highly liquid securities issued by high credit quality issuers and, by policy, limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The Company&#146;s general policy is to limit the risk of principal loss and ensure the safety of invested funds by limiting market and credit risk. All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less are classified as cash equivalents; highly liquid investments with maturities greater than three months are classified as short-term investments. As of September 24, 2005, approximately $287 million of the Company&#146;s short-term investments had underlying maturities ranging from 1 to 5 years. As of September 25, 2004, $180 million of the Company&#146;s investment portfolio classified as short-term investments had maturities ranging from 1 to 5 years. The remainder all had underlying maturities between 3 and 12 months. The Company may sell its investments prior to their stated maturities, due to liquidity needs, in anticipation of credit deterioration, or for duration management. The Company recognized a net loss before taxes of $137,000 in 2005, and net gains before taxes of $1 million and $21 million in 2004, and 2003, respectively as a result of such sales. 

In order to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the Company&#146;s investment portfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact that a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of September 24, 2005, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $19.9 million decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. As of September 25, 2004, a similar 100 basis point shift in the yield curve would have resulted in a $14.4 million decline in fair value. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity. Except in instances noted above, the Company&#146;s policy is to hold investments to maturity. 

From time to time, the Company has entered into interest rate derivative transactions with financial institutions in order to better match the Company&#146;s floating-rate interest income on its cash equivalents and short-term investments with its fixed-rate interest expense on its debt, and/or to diversify a portion of the Company&#146;s exposure away from fluctuations in short-term U.S. interest rates. The Company did not enter into any interest rate derivatives during 2005 or 2004 and had no open interest rate derivatives at September 24, 2005. 

Foreign Currency Risk 

In general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, may negatively affect the Company&#146;s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is also a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. 

The Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows, and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. Generally, the Company&#146;s practice is to hedge a majority of its existing material foreign exchange transaction exposures. However, the Company may not hedge certain foreign exchange transaction exposures due to immateriality, prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures, and limited availability of appropriate hedging instruments. 

In order to provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Company&#146;s foreign currency derivative positions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (VAR) model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo simulation to generate 3000 random market price paths. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company&#146;s foreign exchange portfolio due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. The model assumes normal market conditions. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments, and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates with 95% confidence a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $10.0 million as of September 24, 2005 compared to a maximum one-day loss of $3.2 million as of September 25, 2004. Because the Company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, losses incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures. 

Actual future gains and losses associated with the Company&#146;s investment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of September 24, 2005 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the changes in the timing and amount of interest rates, foreign currency exchanges rates, and the Company&#146;s actual exposures and positions.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Note 1&#151;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

Apple Computer, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company) designs, manufactures, and markets personal computers and related software, services, peripherals, and networking solutions. The Company also designs, develops, and markets a line of portable digital music players along with related accessories and services including the online distribution of third-party music, audio books, music videos, short films, and television shows. The Company sells its products worldwide through its online stores, its own retail stores, its direct sales force, and third-party wholesalers, resellers, and value-added resellers. In addition to its own hardware, software, and peripheral products, the Company sells a variety of third-party hardware and software products through its online and retail stores. The Company sells to education, consumer, creative professional, business, and government customers. 

Basis of Presentation and Preparation 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior year amounts in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. 

Typically, the Company&#146;s fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of September. Fiscal years 2005, 2004, and 2003 were each 52-week years. However, approximately every six years, the Company reports a 53-week fiscal year to align its fiscal quarters with calendar quarters by adding a week to its first fiscal quarter. The Company will add this additional week in the first fiscal quarter of its fiscal year 2006. All information presented herein is based on the Company&#146;s fiscal calendar. 

Common Stock Split 

On February 28, 2005, the Company effected a two-for-one stock split to shareholders of record as of February 18, 2005. All share and per share information has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split. 

Financial Instruments 

Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments 

All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents. Highly liquid investments with maturities greater than three months are classified as short-term investments. The Company&#146;s debt and marketable equity securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. Management determines the appropriate classification of its investments in debt and marketable equity securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates available-for-sale designation as of each balance sheet date. These securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a component of shareholders&#146; equity. The cost of securities sold is based upon the specific identification method. 

Derivative Financial Instruments 

The Company accounts for its derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and carries them at fair value. Derivatives that are not defined as hedges in SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, must be adjusted to fair value through earnings. If the derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in fair value will either be offset against the change in fair value of the 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

Note 1&#151;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 

hedged assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through earnings, or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. 

For derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that are designated as cash flow hedges, the net gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders&#146; equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. To receive hedge accounting treatment, cash flow hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to expected future cash flows on hedged transactions. For derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability and that are designated as fair value hedges, the net gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings in the current period. The net gain or loss on the effective portion of a derivative instrument that is designated as an economic hedge of the foreign currency translation exposure of the net investment in a foreign operation is reported in the same manner as a foreign currency translation adjustment. For forward contracts designated as net investment hedges, the Company excludes changes in fair value relating to changes in the forward carry component from its definition of effectiveness. Accordingly, any gains or losses related to this component are recognized in current earnings. 

The Company may enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the translation and economic exposure of a net investment position in a foreign subsidiary. For such contracts, hedge effectiveness is measured based on changes in the fair value of the contract attributable to changes in the spot exchange rate. The effective portion of the net gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated as a hedge of the net investment position in a foreign subsidiary is reported in the same manner as a foreign currency translation adjustment. Any residual changes in fair value of the forward contract, including changes in fair value based on the differential between the spot and forward exchange rates, are recognized in current earnings in other income and expense. 

Inventories 

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, computed using the first-in, first-out method, or market. If the cost of the inventories exceeds their market value, provisions are made currently for the difference between the cost and the market value. The Company&#146;s inventories consist primarily of finished goods for all periods presented. 

Property, Plant, and Equipment 

Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed by use of the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are 30 years for buildings, up to 5 years for equipment, and the shorter of lease terms or 10 years for leasehold improvements. The Company capitalizes eligible costs to acquire or develop internal-use software that are incurred subsequent to the preliminary project stage. Capitalized costs related to internal-use software are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from 3 to 5 years. Depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment was $141 million, $126 million, and $108 million during 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.

Asset Retirement Obligations 

The Company records obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs in accordance with SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations . The Company reviews legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and/or normal use of the assets. If it is determined that a legal obligation exists, the fair value of the liability for an asset retirement obligation is recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset. The difference between the gross expected future cash flow and its present value is accreted over the life of the related lease as an operating expense. All of the Company&#146;s existing asset retirement obligations are associated with commitments to return property subject to operating leases to original condition upon lease termination. 

The following table reconciles changes in the Company&#146;s asset retirement liabilities for fiscal 2004 and 2005 (in millions):

Cumulative Effects of Accounting Changes 

In 2003, the Company recognized a net favorable cumulative effect type adjustment of approximately $1 million from the adoption of SFAS No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristic of Both Liabilities and Equity and SFAS No. 143. 

Long-Lived Assets Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets 

The Company reviews property, plant, and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles, excluding goodwill, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If property, plant, and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair market value. For the three fiscal years ended September 24, 2005, the Company had no material impairment of its long-lived assets, except for the impairment of certain assets in connection with the restructuring actions described in Note 5 of these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives should not be amortized but rather be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that they may be impaired. The Company performs its goodwill impairment tests on or about August 30 of each year. The Company did not recognize any goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges in 2005, 2004, or 2003. The Company established reporting units based on its current reporting structure. For purposes of testing goodwill for 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

Note 1&#151;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 

impairment, goodwill has been allocated to these reporting units to the extent it relates to each reporting unit.SFAS No. 142 also requires that intangible assets with definite lives be amortized over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of . The Company is currently amortizing its acquired intangible assets with definite lives over periods ranging from 3 to 10 years. 

Foreign Currency Translation 

The Company translates the assets and liabilities of its international non-U.S. functional currency subsidiaries into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of each period. Revenue and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. Gains and losses from these translations are credited or charged to foreign currency translation included in &#147;accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)&#148; in shareholders&#146; equity. The Company&#146;s foreign manufacturing subsidiaries and certain other international subsidiaries that use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency remeasure monetary assets and liabilities at exchange rates in effect at the end of each period, and inventories, property, and nonmonetary assets and liabilities at historical rates. Gains and losses from these translations were insignificant and have been included in the Company&#146;s results of operations. 

Revenue Recognition 

Net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, peripherals, digital content, and service and support contracts. The Company recognizes revenue pursuant to applicable accounting standards, including Statement of Position (SOP) No. 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition , as amended, and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 104, Revenue Recognition . 

The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred. For most of the Company&#146;s product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company legally retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. If at the outset of an arrangement the Company determines the arrangement fee is not, or is presumed to not be, fixed or determinable, revenue is deferred and subsequently recognized as amounts become due and payable. 

Revenue from service and support contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the service coverage periods. These contracts typically include extended phone support, repair services, web-based support resources, diagnostic tools, and extend the service coverage offered under the Company&#146;s one-year limited warranty. 

The Company sells software and peripheral products obtained from other companies. The Company establishes its own pricing and retains related inventory risk, is the primary obligor in sales transactions with its customers, and assumes the credit risk for amounts billed to its customers. Accordingly, the Company recognizes revenue for the sale of products obtained from other companies at the gross amount billed. 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

Note 1&#151;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 

Revenue on arrangements that include multiple elements such as hardware, software, and services is allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each element. Each element&#146;s allocated revenue is recognized when revenue recognition criteria for that element has been met. Fair value is generally determined by vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE), which is based on the price charged when each element is sold separately. If the Company cannot objectively determine the fair value of any undelivered element included in a multiple-element arrangement, the Company defers revenue until all elements are delivered and services have been performed, or until fair value can objectively be determined for any remaining undelivered elements. When the fair value of a delivered element has not been established, the Company uses the residual method to recognize revenue if the fair value of all undelivered elements is determinable. Under the residual method, the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements and is recognized as revenue.

The Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive programs, including reseller and end user rebates, and other sales programs and volume-based incentives. The estimated cost of these programs is accrued as a reduction to revenue in the period the Company has sold the product and committed to a plan. The Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the Company&#146;s historical experience. 

Generally, the Company does not offer specified or unspecified upgrade rights to its customers in connection with software sales or the sale of extended warranty and support contracts. When the Company does offer specified upgrade rights, the Company defers revenue for the fair value of the specified upgrade right until the future obligation is fulfilled or when the right to the specified upgrade expires. Additionally, a limited number of the Company&#146;s software products are available with maintenance agreements that grant customers rights to unspecified future upgrades over the maintenance term on a when and if available basis. Revenue associated with such maintenance is recognized ratably over the maintenance term. 

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 

The Company records its allowance for doubtful accounts based upon its assessment of various factors. The Company considers historical experience, the age of the accounts receivable balances, credit quality of the Company&#146;s customers, current economic conditions and other factors that may affect customers&#146; ability to pay. 

Shipping Costs 

The Company&#146;s shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales for all periods presented. 

Warranty Expense 

The Company provides currently for the estimated cost for product warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. The Company assesses the adequacy of its preexisting warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual experience and changes in future estimates. 

Software Development Costs 

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Development costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed are subject to capitalization beginning when a product&#146;s technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to customers 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

Note 1&#151;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 

pursuant to SFAS No. 86, Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed . In most instances, the Company&#146;s products are released soon after technological feasibility has been established. Therefore, costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility are usually not significant, and generally all software development costs have been expensed. 

In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company began incurring substantial development costs associated with Mac OS X version 10.4 Tiger subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility as evidenced by public demonstration in August 2004 and the subsequent release of a developer beta version of the product. The Company capitalized approximately $29.7 and $4.5 million during 2005 and 2004, respectively, of costs associated with the development of Tiger. In accordance with SFAS No. 86, amortization of this asset to cost of sales began in April 2005 when the Company began shipping Tiger and is being recognized on a straight-line basis over a 3 year estimated useful life. 

During the second quarter of 2004, the Company incurred substantial development costs associated with FileMaker Pro 7 subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility as evidenced by public demonstration and release of a developer beta version, and prior to the release of the final version of the product in March 2004. Therefore, during the second quarter of 2004, the Company capitalized approximately $2.3 million of costs associated with the development of FileMaker Pro 7. In accordance with SFAS No. 86, amortization of this asset to cost of sales began in March 2004 when the Company began shipping FileMaker Pro 7 and is being recognized on a straight-line basis over a 3 year estimated useful life. 

During the third and fourth quarters of 2003, the Company incurred substantial development costs associated with the development of Mac OS X version 10.3 (code-named &#147;Panther&#148;), subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility as evidenced by public demonstration and release of a developer beta in June 2003, and prior to release of the final version of the product in the first quarter of 2004. Therefore, during 2003 the Company capitalized approximately $14.7 million of development costs associated with the development of Panther. Amortization of this asset began in the first quarter of 2004 when Panther was shipped and is being recognized on a straight-line basis in accordance with SFAS No. 86 over a 3 year estimated useful life. 

Total amortization related to capitalized software development costs was $15.7 million, $10.7 million, and $5.8 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. 

Advertising Costs 

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $287 million, $206 million, and $193 million for 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. 

Stock-Based Compensation 

The Company currently measures compensation expense for its employee stock-based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees . The Company applies the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-based Compensation , as amended by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-based Compensation&#151;Transition and Disclosure as if the fair-value-based method had been applied in measuring compensation expense. Under APB Opinion No. 25, when the exercise price of the Company&#146;s employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of the grant, no compensation expense is recognized. 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

Note 1&#151;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 

As required under SFAS No. 123, the pro forma effects of stock-based compensation on net income and earnings per common share for employee stock options granted and employee stock purchase plan share purchases have been estimated at the date of grant and beginning of the period, respectively, using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the options and shares is amortized to pro forma net income over the options&#146; vesting period and the shares&#146; plan period.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) (SFAS No. 123R), Share-Based Payment , which addresses the accounting for share-based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for (a) equity instruments of the enterprise or (b) liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise&#146;s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments. SFAS No. 123R eliminates the ability to account for share-based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method under APB Opinion No. 25, and requires instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair-value-based method. In January 2005, the SEC issued SAB No. 107, which provides supplemental implementation guidance for SFAS No. 123R. SFAS No. 123R will be effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of its fiscal 2006. The Company&#146;s assessment of the estimated stock-based compensation expense is affected by the Company&#146;s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex variables and the related tax impact. These variables include, but are not limited to, the Company&#146;s stock price, volatility, and employee stock option exercise behaviors and the related tax impact. The Company will recognize stock-based compensation expense on all awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period using the modified prospective method. Although the adoption of SFAS No. 123R is expected to have a material effect on the Company&#146;s results of operations, future changes to various assumptions used to determine the fair-value of awards issued or the amount and type of equity awards granted create uncertainty as to whether future stock-based compensation expense will be similar to the historical SFAS No. 123 pro forma expense.

Earnings Per Common Share 

Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential shares of common stock had been issued. The dilutive effect of outstanding options, restricted stock and restricted stock units is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, an increase in the fair market value of the Company&#146;s common stock can result in a greater dilutive effect from outstanding options, restricted stock and restricted stock units. Additionally, the exercise of employee stock options and the vesting of restricted stock and restricted stock units can result in a greater dilutive effect on earnings per share. 

The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share:

Potentially dilutive securities representing approximately 12.4 million, 8.7 million, and 101.6 million shares of common stock for the years ended September 24, 2005, September 25, 2004, and September 27, 2003, respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for these periods because their effect would have been antidilutive. These potentially dilutive securities include stock options, restricted stock, and restricted stock units. 

Comprehensive Income 

Comprehensive income consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income refers to revenue, expenses, gains and losses that under generally accepted accounting principles are recorded as an element of shareholders&#146; equity but are excluded from net income. The Company&#146;s other comprehensive income is comprised of foreign currency translation adjustments from those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities categorized as available-for-sale, and net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges.

&#160; 

Market values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. The decline in value of these investments is primarily related to changes in interest rates and is considered to be temporary in nature. Investments are reviewed periodically to identify possible impairment. When evaluating the investments, the Company reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer, and the Company&#146;s ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time which may be sufficient for anticipated recovery in market value. 

Accounts Receivable 

Trade Receivables 

The Company distributes its products through third-party resellers and directly to certain education, consumer, and commercial customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers. However, when possible the Company does attempt to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers in Latin America, Europe, and Asia and by arranging with third-party financing companies to provide flooring arrangements and other loan and lease programs to the Company&#146;s direct customers. These credit financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements. However, considerable trade receivables that

Note 2&#151;Financial Instruments (Continued) 

are not covered by collateral, third-party flooring arrangements, or credit insurance are outstanding with the Company&#146;s distribution and retail channel partners. No customer accounted for more than 10% of trade receivables as of September 24, 2005 or September 25, 2004.

Vendor Non-Trade Receivables 

The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of raw material components to these manufacturing vendors who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these raw material components directly from suppliers. These non-trade receivables, which are included in the consolidated balance sheets in other current assets, totaled $417 million and $276 million as of September 24, 2005 and September 25, 2004, respectively. The Company does not reflect the sale of these components in net sales and does not recognize any profits on these sales until the products are sold through to the end customer at which time the profit is recognized as a reduction of cost of sales. 

Derivative Financial Instruments 

The Company uses derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. Foreign currency forward and option contracts are used to offset the foreign exchange risk on certain existing assets and liabilities and to hedge the foreign exchange risk on expected future cash flows on certain forecasted revenue and cost of sales. From time to time, the Company enters into interest rate derivative agreements to modify the interest rate profile of certain investments and debt. The Company&#146;s accounting policies for these instruments are based on whether the instruments are designated as hedge or non-hedge instruments. The Company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.

##TABLE_END 

&#160; 

The notional principal amounts for derivative instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume outstanding as of year-end, and do not represent the amount of the Company&#146;s exposure to credit or market loss. The credit risk amount shown in the table above represents the Company&#146;s gross exposure to potential accounting loss on these transactions if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency exchange rates at each respective date. The Company&#146;s exposure to credit loss and market risk will vary over time as a function of currency exchange rates. 

The estimates of fair value are based on applicable and commonly used pricing models and prevailing financial market information as of September 24, 2005 and September 25, 2004. Although the table above reflects the notional principal, fair value, and credit risk amounts of the Company&#146;s foreign exchange instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated with the exposures and transactions that the foreign exchange instruments are intended to hedge. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments. 

Foreign Exchange Risk Management 

The Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risk associated with existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows, and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. Generally, the Company&#146;s practice is to hedge a majority of its existing material foreign exchange transaction exposures. However, the Company may not hedge certain foreign exchange transaction exposures due to immateriality, prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures, or limited availability of appropriate hedging instruments. 

To help protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company&#146;s U.S. dollar functional subsidiaries hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenues, and the Company&#146;s non-U.S. dollar functional subsidiaries selling in local currencies hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries&#146; functional currency. Other comprehensive income associated with hedges of foreign currency revenues is recognized as a component of net sales in the same

Note 2&#151;Financial Instruments (Continued) 

period as the related sales are recognized, and other comprehensive income related to inventory purchases is recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs are recognized. Typically, the Company hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenues and inventory purchases over a time horizon of 3 to 6 months. 

Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable that the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within a subsequent 2 month time period. Deferred gains and losses in other comprehensive income associated with such derivative instruments are immediately reclassified into earnings in other income and expense. Any subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are also reflected in current earnings unless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions. The Company recognized net losses of $1.6 million and $2.8 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively, in other income and expense related to the loss of hedge designation on discontinued cash flow hedges due to changes in the Company&#146;s forecast of future net sales and cost of sales and due to prevailing market conditions. No net gains, or losses, of a similar nature were recorded in 2003. As of September 24, 2005, the Company had a net deferred gain associated with cash flow hedges of approximately $3.6 million, net of taxes, substantially all of which is expected to be reclassified to earnings by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2006. 

The net gain or loss on the effective portion of a derivative instrument designated as a net investment hedge is included in the cumulative translation adjustment account of accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders&#146; equity. As of September 24, 2005 and September 25, 2004, the Company had a net gain of $673,000 and a net loss of $1.8 million, respectively, included in the cumulative translation adjustment. 

The Company may also enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the foreign exchange gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of certain assets and liabilities recorded in non-functional currencies. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized in current earnings in other income and expense as offsets to the changes in the fair value of the related assets or liabilities. Due to currency market movements, changes in option time value can lead to increased volatility in other income and expense. 

Interest Rate Risk Management 

From time to time, the Company historically entered into interest rate derivative transactions with financial institutions in order to better match the Company&#146;s floating-rate interest income on its cash equivalents and short-term investments with its fixed-rate interest expense on any outstanding long-term debt, and/or to diversify a portion of the Company&#146;s exposure away from fluctuations in short-term U.S. interest rates. 

During 2001 and 2002, the Company entered into and then subsequently terminated various interest rate debt swap agreements generating a realized gain of $23 million. These gains were deferred and amortized over the remaining life of the underlying debt, which matured and was repaid in February 2004. 

As of September 24, 2005 and September 25, 2004, the Company had no interest rate derivatives outstanding.

Non-Current Debt and Equity Investments and Related Gains and Losses 

The Company previously held significant investments in ARM Holdings plc (ARM), Akamai Technologies, Inc. (Akamai), and EarthLink Network, Inc. (EarthLink). T he Company sold all of the remaining holdings in these non-current investments in 2004 and 2003. Pretax gains recorded upon the sale of these non-current investments were $4 million and $10 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively.

During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company recorded an adjustment of approximately $11 million to goodwill relating to a reduction of valuation allowances that were recorded at the time certain net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs) were acquired in previous business combinations. During the fourth quarter of 2005, these NOLs were deemed to be more likely than not to be realized and accordingly the valuation allowances were reversed against the related goodwill that was recognized at the time of the acquisitions. 

During the third quarter of 2004, the Company recorded an adjustment of approximately $5 million to goodwill related to the acquisition of PowerSchool, Inc. (PowerSchool) in 2001. This reduction of goodwill included the cancellation of 158,334 shares of the Company&#146;s common stock, valued at approximately $2 million, that were previously held in escrow and were refunded upon resolution of certain matters arising out of the acquisition of PowerSchool. This adjustment also included approximately $3 million to adjust the original estimates of the pre-acquisition PowerSchool restructuring liability to actual costs incurred.

Of the $26.8 million charge, all had been utilized by the end of 2005, except for approximately $1.7 million related to operating lease costs on abandoned facilities. During the third quarter of 2003, approximately $500,000 of the amount originally accrued for lease cancellations was determined to be in excess due to the sublease of a property sooner than originally expected and a shortfall

of approximately $500,000 was identified in the severance accrual due to higher than expected severance costs related to the closure of the Company&#146;s Singapore manufacturing operations. These adjustments had no net effect on reported operating expense. These actions resulted in the termination of 353 employees.

The foreign provision for income taxes is based on foreign pretax earnings of approximately $922 million, $384 million, and $250 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. As of September 24, 2005, approximately $4.3 billion of the Company&#146;s cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments were held by foreign subsidiaries and are generally based in U.S. dollar-denominated holdings. Amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to U.S. income taxation on repatriation to the U.S. The Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements fully provide for any related tax liability on amounts that may be repatriated, aside from undistributed earnings of certain of the Company&#146;s foreign subsidiaries that are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the U.S. U.S. income taxes have not been provided on a cumulative total of $1.2 billion of such earnings. It is not practicable to determine the income tax liability that might be incurred if these earnings were to be distributed.

Note 6&#151;Income Taxes (Continued) 

On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act (AJCA) was signed into law. The AJCA includes a provision for the deduction of 85% of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated, as defined in the AJCA. The legislation provided the Company with the option to apply this provision to repatriations of qualifying earnings in either 2005 or 2006. The Company is continuing to evaluate the effects of the repatriation provision and expects to complete the evaluation in 2006. A maximum of $755 million may be eligible for repatriation under the reduced tax rate provided by AJCA. However, given the uncertainties and complexities of the repatriation provision and the Company&#146;s continuing evaluation, the Company has not yet determined the amount that may be repatriated or the related potential income tax effects of such repatriation. 

Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the effects of tax losses, credits, and the future income tax effects of temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. 

As of September 24, 2005 and September 25, 2004, the significant components of the Company&#146;s deferred tax assets and liabilities were (in millions):

As of September 24, 2005, the Company had operating loss carryforwards for federal tax purposes of approximately $62 million, which expire from 2011 through 2024. A portion of these carryforwards was acquired from the Company&#146;s previous acquisitions, the utilization of which is subject to certain limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. The Company also has Federal credit carryforwards and various state and foreign tax loss and credit carryforwards, the tax effect of which is approximately $206 million and which expire between 2010 and 2025. The remaining benefits from tax losses and credits do not expire. As of September 24, 2005 and September 25, 2004, a valuation allowance of $5 million and $30 million, respectively, was recorded against the deferred tax asset for the benefits of tax losses that may not be realized. The remaining valuation allowance relates principally to the state operating losses. Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets.

During 2005, the Company reversed certain tax contingency reserves and recorded a corresponding benefit to income tax expense primarily as a result of a change in the estimated outcome of certain tax disputes. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company recorded a benefit to tax expense to adjust its net deferred tax assets as a result of the Company&#146;s year-end review of its deferred tax accounts, the impact of which was not material to the current or prior periods&#146; results of operations. The total benefit to income tax expense from the reversal of these tax contingency reserves and adjustments to net deferred tax assets was $67 million. The Company also recorded a $14 million credit to income tax expense resulting from a reduction of the valuation allowance. 

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has completed its field audit of the Company&#146;s federal income tax returns for all years prior to 2002 and proposed certain adjustments. Certain of these adjustments are being contested through the IRS Appeals Office. Substantially all IRS audit issues for these years have been resolved. In addition, the Company is also subject to audits by state, local, and foreign tax authorities. Management believes that adequate provisions have been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. Should any issues addressed in the Company&#146;s tax audits be resolved in a manner not consistent with management&#146;s expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income tax in the period such resolution occurs.

Preferred Stock 

The Company has 5 million shares of authorized preferred stock, none of which is outstanding. Under the terms of the Company&#146;s Restated Articles of Incorporation, the Board of Directors is authorized to determine or alter the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of the Company&#146;s authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock.

Restricted Stock Units 

During 2005 and 2004, the Company&#146;s Board of Directors approved the grant of 230,000 and 5.03 million restricted stock units, respectively, to members of the Company&#146;s senior management team, excluding its CEO. These restricted stock units generally vest over four years either in two equal installments on the second and fourth anniversaries of the date of grant or in equal installments on each of the first through fourth anniversaries of the grant date. Upon vesting, the restricted stock units will convert into an equivalent number of shares of common stock. The Company has recorded $10.3 million and $64.4 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively, in value for these restricted stock units as a component of shareholders&#146; equity and is amortizing the amounts on a straight-line basis over the four-year requisite service period. The value of the restricted stock units was based on the closing market price of the Company&#146;s common stock on the date of grant. The restricted stock units have been included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share utilizing the treasury stock method. 

CEO Restricted Stock Award 

On March 19, 2003, the Company entered into an Option Cancellation and Restricted Stock Award Agreement (the Agreement) with Mr. Steven P. Jobs, its CEO. The Agreement cancelled stock option awards for the purchase of 55 million shares of the Company&#146;s common stock previously granted to Mr. Jobs in 2000 and 2001. Mr. Jobs retained options to purchase 120,000 shares of the Company&#146;s common stock granted in August of 1997 in his capacity as a member of the Company&#146;s Board of Directors, prior to becoming the Company&#146;s CEO. The Agreement replaced the cancelled options with a restricted stock award of 10 million shares of the Company&#146;s common stock. The restricted stock award generally vests three years from the date of grant. Vesting of some or all of the restricted shares will be accelerated in the event Mr. Jobs is terminated without cause, dies, or has his management role reduced following a change in control of the Company. 

The Company determined the value of the restricted stock award in accordance with APB Opinion No. 25 and has recorded the value as deferred stock compensation as a component of shareholders&#146; equity and is amortizing that amount on a straight-line basis over the 3 year service period. The value of the restricted stock award was based on the closing market price of the Company&#146;s common stock on the date of the award. The 10 million restricted shares have been included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share utilizing the treasury stock method. 

Stock Repurchase Plan 

In July 1999, the Company&#146;s Board of Directors authorized a plan for the Company to repurchase up to $500 million of its common stock. This repurchase plan does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares or acquire shares over any specified period of time. 

During the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company entered into a forward purchase agreement to acquire 3.1 million shares of its common stock in September of 2003 at an average price of $8.32 per share for a total cost of $25.5 million. In August 2003, the Company settled this agreement prior to its maturity, at which time the Company&#146;s common stock had a fair value of $11.41. Other than this forward purchase transaction, the Company has not engaged in any transactions to repurchase its common stock since 2000. Since inception of the stock repurchase plan, the Company had repurchased a total of 13.1 million shares at a cost of $217 million. The Company was authorized to repurchase up to an additional $283 million of its common stock as of September 24, 2005.

Comprehensive Income 

Comprehensive income consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income refers to revenue, expenses, gains and losses that under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles are recorded as an element of shareholders&#146; equity but are excluded from net income. The Company&#146;s other comprehensive income consists of foreign currency translation adjustments from those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities categorized as available-for-sale, and net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges.

2003 Employee Stock Plan 

The 2003 Employee Stock Plan (the 2003 Plan) is a shareholder approved plan that provides for broad-based grants to employees, including executive officers. Based on the terms of individual option grants, options granted under the 2003 Plan generally expire 7 to 10 years after the grant date and generally become exercisable over a period of 4 years, based on continued employment, with either annual or quarterly vesting. The 2003 Plan permits the granting of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, and stock purchase rights. 

1997 Employee Stock Option Plan 

In August 1997, the Company&#146;s Board of Directors approved the 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan (the 1997 Plan), a non-shareholder approved plan for grants of stock options to employees who are not officers of the Company. Based on the terms of individual option grants, options granted under the 1997 Plan generally expire 7 to 10 years after the grant date and generally become exercisable over a period of 4 years, based on continued employment, with either annual or quarterly vesting. In October 2003, the Company terminated the 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan and cancelled all remaining unissued shares totaling 28,590,702. No new options can be granted from the 1997 Plan. 

Employee Stock Option Exchange Program 

On March 20, 2003, the Company announced a voluntary employee stock option exchange program (the Exchange Program) whereby eligible employees, other than executive officers and members of the Board of Directors, had an opportunity to exchange outstanding options with exercise prices at or above $12.50 per share for a predetermined smaller number of new stock options issued with exercise prices equal to the fair market value of one share of the Company&#146;s common stock on the day the new awards were issued, which was to be at least six months plus one day after the exchange options were cancelled. On April 17, 2003, in accordance with the Exchange Program, the Company cancelled options to purchase 33,138,386 shares of its common stock. On October 22, 2003, new stock options totaling 13,394,736 shares were issued to employees at an exercise price of $11.38 per share, which is equivalent to the closing price of the Company&#146;s stock on that date. No financial or accounting impact to the Company&#146;s financial position, results of operations or cash flow was associated with this transaction. 

1997 Director Stock Option Plan 

In August 1997, the Company&#146;s Board of Directors adopted a shareholder approved Director Stock Option Plan (DSOP) for non-employee directors of the Company. Initial grants of 30,000 options under the DSOP vest in three equal installments on each of the first through third anniversaries of the date of grant, and subsequent annual grants of 10,000 options are fully vested at grant. 

Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans 

Certain of the Company&#146;s executive officers, including Mr. Timothy D. Cook, Mr. Peter Oppenheimer, Mr. Jonathan Rubinstein, Mr. Philip W. Schiller, Dr. Bertrand Serlet, and Dr. Avadis Tevanian, Jr., have entered into trading plans pursuant to Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. A trading plan is a written document that pre-establishes the amounts, prices and dates (or formula for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of the Company&#146;s stock including the exercise and sale of employee stock options and shares acquired pursuant to the Company&#146;s employee stock purchase plan and upon vesting of restricted stock units.

Note 8&#151;Employee Benefit Plans (Continued) 

Employee Stock Purchase Plan 

The Company has a shareholder approved employee stock purchase plan (the Purchase Plan), under which substantially all employees may purchase common stock through payroll deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market values as of the beginning and end of six month offering periods. Stock purchases under the Purchase Plan are limited to 10% of an employee&#146;s compensation, up to a maximum of $25,000 in any calendar year. Beginning with the six-month offering period that started on June 30, 2003, the number of shares authorized for issuance is limited to a total of 1 million shares per offering period. During 2005, 2004, and 2003, adjusted for the February 2005 stock split 2.3 million, 3.9 million, and 4.3 million shares, respectively, were issued under the Purchase Plan. As of September 24, 2005, approximately 3.8 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the Purchase Plan. 

Employee Savings Plan 

The Company has an employee savings plan (the Savings Plan) qualifying as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the Savings Plan, participating U.S. employees may defer a portion of their pre-tax earnings, up to the Internal Revenue Service annual contribution limit ($14,000 for calendar year 2005). The Company matches 50% to 100% of each employee&#146;s contributions, depending on length of service, up to a maximum 6% of the employee&#146;s earnings. The Company&#146;s matching contributions to the Savings Plan were approximately $28 million, $24 million, and $21 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.

&#160; 

As of September 25, 2004, the Company had exercisable options outstanding to purchase 60.0 million shares with a weighted average exercise price of $10.30 per share. As of September 27, 2003, the Company had exercisable options outstanding to purchase 77.5 million shares with a weighted average exercise price of $9.38 per share. 

The Company had 5.03 million restricted stock units outstanding as of September 24, 2005, which were excluded from the options outstanding balances in the preceding tables. None of these restricted stock units was vested as of September 24, 2005. These restricted stock units have been deducted from the shares available for grant under the Company&#146;s stock option plans. 

Note 9&#151;Stock-Based Compensation 

The Company has provided pro forma disclosures in Note 1 of these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the effect on net income and earnings per share as if the fair value method of accounting for stock compensation had been used for its employee stock option grants and employee stock purchase plan purchases. These pro forma effects have been estimated at the date of grant and beginning of the period, respectively, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. 

For purposes of the pro forma disclosures provided pursuant to SFAS No. 123, the option awards issued in October 2003 and the awards cancelled as part of the Employee Stock Option Exchange Program have been accounted for using modification accounting. In accordance with SFAS No. 123, the grant date of the awards issued is the date of acceptance of the exchange offer by participating employees. The cancellation of certain of the Company&#146;s CEO&#146;s options and replacement with restricted shares in March 2003 is also being accounted for using modification accounting for purposes of the pro forma disclosures provided pursuant to SFAS No. 123.

For purposes of the pro forma disclosures provided pursuant to SFAS No. 123, the expected volatility assumptions used by the Company are based on the historical volatility of the Company&#146;s common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of the Company&#146;s stock options and other relevant factors including implied volatility in market traded options on the Company&#146;s common stock and the impact of unusual fluctuations not reasonably expected to recur on the historical volatility of the Company&#146;s common stock. The Company bases its expected life assumption on its historical experience and on the terms and conditions of the stock options it grants to employees. 

Note 10&#151;Commitments and Contingencies 

Lease Commitments 

The Company leases various equipment and facilities, including retail space, under noncancelable operating lease arrangements. The Company does not currently utilize any other off-balance-sheet financing arrangements. The major facility leases are for terms of 5 to 15 years and generally provide renewal options for terms of 3 to 5 additional years. Leases for retail space are for terms of 5 to 20 years, the majority of which are for 10 years, and often contain multi-year renewal options. As of September 24, 2005, the Company&#146;s total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were $865 million, of which $606 million related to leases for retail space.

Accrued Warranty and Indemnifications 

The Company offers a basic limited parts and labor warranty on its hardware products. The basic warranty period for hardware products is typically one year from the date of purchase by the end-user. The Company also offers a 90-day basic warranty for its service parts used to repair the Company&#146;s hardware products. The Company provides currently for the estimated cost that may be incurred under its basic limited product warranties at the time related revenue is recognized. Factors considered in determining appropriate accruals for product warranty obligations include the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection, historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the Company&#146;s typical experience. The Company assesses the adequacy of its preexisting warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual experience and changes in future estimates. 

The following table reconciles changes in the Company&#146;s accrued warranties and related costs (in millions):

The Company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual property rights. Other agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the Company or an indemnified third-party. However, the Company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against itself or an indemnified third-party and, in the opinion of management, does not have a potential liability related to unresolved infringement claims subject to indemnification that would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. Therefore, the Company did not record a liability for infringement costs as of either September 24, 2005 or September 25, 2004.

Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product 

Although most components essential to the Company&#146;s business are generally available from multiple sources, other key components (including microprocessors and application-specific integrated circuits (&#147;ASICs&#148;)) are currently obtained by the Company from single or limited sources. Some other key components, while currently available to the Company from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide availability and pricing pressures. In addition, the Company uses some components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer industry, and new products introduced by the Company often initially utilize custom components obtained from only one source until the Company has evaluated whether there is a need for and subsequently qualifies additional suppliers. If the supply of a key single-sourced component to the Company were to be delayed or curtailed, or in the event a key manufacturing vendor delays shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company&#146;s ability to ship related products in desired quantities and in a timely manner could be adversely affected. The Company&#146;s business and financial performance could also be adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability of these components may be affected if producers were to decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company&#146;s requirements. Finally, significant portions of the Company&#146;s CPUs, logic boards, and assembled products are now manufactured by outsourcing partners, primarily in various parts of Asia. Although the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the Company&#146;s operating results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production obligations. 

Long-Term Supply Agreements 

Subsequent to September 24, 2005, the Company entered into long-term supply agreements with Hynix Semiconductor, Inc., Intel Corporation, Micron Technology, Inc., Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., and Toshiba Corporation to secure supply of NAND flash memory through calendar year 2010. As part of these agreements, the Company intends to prepay a total of $1.25 billion for flash memory components by the end of the second quarter of 2006. 

Contingencies 

The Company is subject to certain other legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not been fully adjudicated. In the opinion of management, the Company does not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and claims that would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, liquidity, or results of operations. However, the results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Should the Company fail to prevail in any of these legal matters or should several of these legal matters be resolved against the Company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected. 

Production and marketing of products in certain states and countries may subject the Company to environmental and other regulations including, in some instances, the requirement to provide customers the ability to return product at the end of its useful life, and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the Company. Such laws and regulations have recently been passed in several jurisdictions in which the Company operates including various European Union member countries, Japan and certain states within the U.S. Although the Company does not anticipate any material adverse effects in the future based on the nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws, there is no assurance that 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

Note 10&#151;Commitments and Contingencies (Continued) 

such existing laws or future laws will not have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s financial condition, liquidity, or results of operations. 

Note 11&#151;Segment Information and Geographic Data 

In accordance with SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information , the Company reports segment information based on the &#147;management&#148; approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company&#146;s reportable segments. 

The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company&#146;s reportable operating segments are comprised of the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Retail. The Americas, Europe, and Japan reportable segments do not include activities related to the Retail segment. The Americas segment includes both North and South America. The Europe segment includes European countries as well as the Middle East and Africa. The Retail segment operates Apple-owned retail stores in the U.S., Canada, Japan, and the U.K. Other operating segments include Asia-Pacific, which includes Australia and Asia except for Japan, and the Company&#146;s subsidiary, FileMaker, Inc. Each reportable geographic operating segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar services, and the accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described in Note 1, &#147;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,&#148; except as described below for the Retail segment. 

The Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on net sales. The Retail segment&#146;s performance is also evaluated based on operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally based on the location of the customers. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales, and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses that are managed outside the operating segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses, manufacturing costs and variances not included in standard costs, income taxes, and various nonrecurring charges. Corporate expenses include research and development, corporate marketing expenses, manufacturing costs and variances not included in standard costs, and other separately managed general and administrative expenses including certain corporate expenses associated with support of the Retail segment. The Company does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes. Segment assets exclude corporate assets. Corporate assets include cash, short-term and long-term investments, manufacturing facilities, miscellaneous corporate infrastructure, goodwill and other acquired intangible assets, and retail store construction-in-progress that is not subject to depreciation. Except for the Retail segment, capital expenditures for long-lived assets are not reported to management by segment. Capital expenditures by the Retail segment were $132 million, $104 million, and $92 million for 2005, 2004, and 2003 respectively. 

Operating income for all segments, except Retail, includes cost of sales at manufacturing standard cost, other cost of sales, related sales and marketing costs, and certain general and administrative costs. This measure of operating income, which includes manufacturing profit, provides a comparable basis for comparison between the Company&#146;s various geographic segments. Certain manufacturing expenses and related adjustments not included in segment cost of sales, including variances between standard and actual manufacturing costs and the mark-up above standard cost for product supplied to the Retail segment, are included in corporate expenses. 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

Note 11&#151;Segment Information and Geographic Data (Continued) 

Management assesses the operating performance of the Retail segment differently than it assesses the operating performance of the Company&#146;s geographic segments. The Retail segment revenue and operating income is intended to depict a measure comparable to that of the Company&#146;s major channel partners in the U.S. operating retail stores so the Company can evaluate the Retail segment performance as if it were a channel partner. Therefore, the Company makes three significant adjustments to the Retail segment for management reporting purposes that are not included in the results of the Company&#146;s other segments. 

First, the Retail segment&#146;s operating income includes cost of sales for Apple products at an amount normally charged to major channel partners in the U.S. operating retail stores, less the cost of sales programs and incentives provided to those channel partners and the Company&#146;s cost to support those partners. For the years ended September 24, 2005, September 25, 2004, and September 27, 2003, this resulted in the recognition of additional cost of sales above standard cost by the Retail segment and an offsetting benefit to corporate expenses of approximately $435 million, $213 million, and $106 million, respectively. 

Second, the Company&#146;s service and support contracts are transferred to the Retail segment at the same cost as that charged to the Company&#146;s major retail channel partners in the U.S., resulting in a measure of revenue and gross margin for those items that is comparable between the Company&#146;s Retail stores and those retail channel partners. The Retail segment recognizes the full amount of revenue and cost of sales of the Company&#146;s service and support contracts at the time of sale. Because the Company has not yet earned the revenue or incurred the costs associated with the sale of these contracts, an offset to these amounts is recognized in other operating segments&#146; net sales and cost of sales. For the year ended September 24, 2005, this resulted in the recognition of net sales and cost of sales by the Retail segment, with corresponding offsets in other operating segments, of $92 million and $64 million, respectively. For the year ended September 25, 2004, the net sales and cost of sales recognized by the Retail segment for sales of service and support contracts were $54 million and $37 million, respectively. For the year ended September 27, 2003, this resulted in the recognition of net sales and cost of sales by the Retail segment of $30 million and $20 million, respectively. 

Third, the Company has opened seven high profile stores in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco, Tokyo, Japan, Osaka, Japan, and London, England as of September 24, 2005. These high profile stores are larger than the Company&#146;s typical retail stores and were designed to further promote brand awareness and provide a venue for certain corporate sales and marketing activities, including corporate briefings. As such, the Company allocates certain operating expenses associated with these stores to corporate marketing expense to reflect the estimated benefit realized Company-wide. The allocation of these operating costs is based on the amount incurred for a high profile store in excess of that incurred by a more typical Company retail location. Expenses allocated to corporate marketing resulting from the operations of these stores were $31 million, $16 million, and $6 million for the years ended September 24, 2005, September 25, 2004, and September 27, 2003, respectively.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

The Board of Directors and Shareholders 

Apple Computer, Inc.: 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Apple Computer, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of September 24, 2005 and September 25, 2004, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders&#146; equity and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 24, 2005. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#146;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 24, 2005 and September 25, 2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 24, 2005, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting as of September 24, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated November 29, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on management&#146;s assessment of, and the effective operation of internal control over financial reporting. 

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for asset retirement obligations and for financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity in 2003.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

The Board of Directors and Shareholders 

Apple Computer, Inc.: 

We have audited management&#146;s assessment, included in the accompanying Management&#146;s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, that Apple Computer, Inc. and subsidiaries maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 24, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Apple Computer, Inc.&#146;s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management&#146;s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of Apple Computer, Inc.&#146;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management&#146;s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#146;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

In our opinion, management&#146;s assessment that Apple Computer, Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 24, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by COSO. Also, in our opinion, Apple Computer, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 24, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by COSO. 

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Apple Computer, Inc. as of September 24, 2005 and September 25, 2004, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders&#146; equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 24, 2005, and our report dated November 29, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.
