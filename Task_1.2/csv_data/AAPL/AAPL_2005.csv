Business Strategy 

The Company is committed to bringing the best personal computing and portable digital music experience to students, educators, creative professionals, businesses, government agencies, and consumers through its innovative hardware, software, peripherals, services, and Internet offerings. The Company&#146;s business strategy leverages its unique ability to design and develop its own operating system, hardware, application software, and services to provide its customers new products and solutions with superior ease-of-use, seamless integration, and innovative industrial design. The Company believes continual investment in research and development is critical to facilitate innovation of new and improved products and technologies. Besides updates to its existing line of personal computers and related software, services, peripherals, and networking solutions, the Company continues to capitalize on the convergence of digital consumer electronics and the personal computer by creating and refining innovations like the iPod and iTunes Store. The Company&#146;s strategy also includes expanding its distribution network to effectively reach more of its targeted customers and provide them with a high-quality sales and after-sales support experience. 

Digital Lifestyle 

The Company believes that for both professionals and consumers the personal computer has become the center of an evolving digital lifestyle by integrating and enhancing the utility of advanced digital devices such as the Company&#146;s iPods, digital video and still cameras, televisions, CD and DVD players, cellular phones, personal digital assistants, and other consumer electronic devices. The attributes of the personal computer that enable this functionality include a high-quality user interface, easy access to relatively inexpensive data storage, the ability to run complex applications, and the ability to connect easily to a wide variety of other digital devices and to the Internet. The Company is the only participant in the personal computer industry that controls the design and development of the entire personal computer&#151;from the hardware and operating system to sophisticated applications. This, along with its products&#146; original industrial designs, intuitive ease-of-use, built-in graphics, multimedia and networking capabilities, uniquely positions the Company to offer innovative integrated digital lifestyle solutions. 

Expanded Distribution 

The Company believes a high-quality buying experience with knowledgeable salespersons that can convey the value of the Company&#146;s products and services greatly enhances its ability to attract and retain customers. The Company sells many of its products and resells certain third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, education customers, and businesses through its retail and online stores. The Company has also invested in programs to enhance reseller sales, including the Apple Sales Consultant Program, which places Apple employees and contractors at selected third-party reseller locations. The Company believes providing direct contact with its targeted customers is an efficient way to demonstrate the advantages of its Macintosh computer and other products over those of its competitors.

One of the goals of the retail initiative is to bring new customers to the Company and expand its installed base through sales to computer users who currently do not own a Macintosh computer and first time personal computer buyers. By operating its own stores and building them in desirable high-traffic locations, the Company is able to better control the customer retail experience and attract new customers. The stores are designed to simplify and enhance the presentation and marketing of personal computers and related products. To that end, retail store configurations have evolved into various sizes in order to accommodate market demands. The stores employ experienced and knowledgeable personnel who provide product advice and certain hardware support services. The stores offer a wide selection of third-party hardware, software, and various other computing products and supplies selected to complement the Company&#146;s own products. Additionally, the stores provide a forum in which the Company is able to offer specialized service and personalized training.

Markets and Distribution 

The Company&#146;s customers are primarily in the education, creative, consumer, and business markets. The Company distributes its products through wholesalers, resellers, national and regional retailers and cataloguers. No individual customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales in 2006, 2005, or 2004. The Company also sells many of its products and resells certain third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, education customers, and businesses through its own sales force and retail and online stores. Ten percent of the Company&#146;s net sales in 2006 were through its U.S. education channel, including sales to elementary and secondary schools, higher education institutions, and individual customers. 

Competition 

The Company is confronted by aggressive competition in all areas of its business. The markets for consumer electronics, personal computers and related software and peripheral products are highly competitive. These markets are characterized by rapid technological advances in both hardware and software that have substantially increased the capabilities and use of personal computers and other digital electronic devices and have resulted in the frequent introduction of new products with competitive price, feature, and performance characteristics. Over the past several years, price competition in these markets have been particularly intense. The Company&#146;s competitors who sell personal computers based on other operating systems have aggressively cut prices and lowered their product margins to gain or maintain market share. The Company&#146;s results of operations and financial condition can be adversely affected by these and other industry-wide downward pressures on gross margins. The principal competitive factors include price, relative price/performance, product quality and reliability, design innovation, availability of software, product features, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, availability of hardware peripherals, and corporate reputation. Further, as the personal computer industry and its customers place more reliance on the Internet, an increasing number of Internet devices that are smaller, simpler, and less expensive than traditional personal computers may compete for market share with the Company&#146;s existing products. 

The Company&#146;s music products and services have faced significant competition from other companies promoting their own digital music and content products and services, including those offering free peer-to-peer music and video services. The Company believes it currently retains a competitive advantage from innovation and by more effectively integrating the entire solution including the hardware (personal computer and iPod), software (iTunes), and distribution of content (iTunes Store). However, the Company expects competition in this space to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the Company&#146;s approach to tightly integrate these components within their individual offerings or, alternatively, collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more integrated than those they currently offer. Some of these current and potential competitors have substantial resources and may be able to provide such products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss to compete with the Company&#146;s offerings. 

The Company&#146;s future operating results and financial condition are substantially dependent on the Company&#146;s ability to continue to develop improvements to the Macintosh platform and to the Company&#146;s hardware, software and services related to digital content to maintain perceived functional and design advantages over competing platforms. 

Raw Materials 

Although most components essential to the Company&#146;s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain key components including microprocessors and application-specific integrated circuits (&#147;ASICs&#148;) are currently obtained by the Company from single or limited sources. Some key components, while currently available to the Company from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide availability constraints and pricing pressures. In addition, the Company uses some components uncommon to the rest of the personal computer and consumer electronics industries, and new products introduced by 

the Company often initially utilize custom components obtained from only one source until the Company has evaluated whether there is a need for, and subsequently qualifies, additional suppliers. If the supply of a key or single-sourced component to the Company were to be delayed or curtailed or in the event a key manufacturing vendor delays shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company&#146;s ability to ship related products in desired quantities and in a timely manner could be adversely affected. The Company&#146;s business and financial performance could also be adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability of these components may be affected if producers were to decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company&#146;s requirements. The Company attempts to mitigate these potential risks by working closely with these and other key suppliers on product introduction plans, strategic inventories, coordinated product introductions, and internal and external manufacturing schedules and levels. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of formal purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. The Company&#146;s purchase commitments typically cover its requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. 

The Company believes there are several component suppliers and manufacturing vendors whose loss to the Company could have a material adverse effect upon the Company&#146;s business and financial position. At this time, such vendors include Agere Systems, Inc., Ambit Microsystems Corporation, Amperex Technology Limited, ASUSTeK Corporation, ATI Technologies, Inc., Atheros Communications Inc., AU Optronics Corporation, Broadcom Corporation, Chi Mei Optoelectronics Corporation, Cypress Semiconductor Corporation, Hitachi Global Storage Technologies, Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd., Intel Corporation, Inventec Appliances Corporation, LG. Phillips Co., Ltd., Matsushita, NVIDIA Corp., PortalPlayer, Inc., Quanta Computer, Inc., Renesas Semiconductor Co. Ltd., Samsung Electronics, Sony Corporation, Synaptics, Inc., Texas Instruments, and Toshiba Corporation. 

Research and Development 

Because the personal computer and consumer electronics industries are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company&#146;s ability to compete successfully is heavily dependent upon its ability to ensure a continuing and timely flow of competitive products, services, and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new products and technologies and to enhance existing products in the areas of hardware and peripherals, consumer electronic products, system software, applications software, networking and communications software and solutions, and the Internet. The Company may expand the range of its product offerings and intellectual property through licensing and/or acquisition of third-party business and technology. The Company&#146;s research and development expenditures totaled $712 million, $535 million (as restated (1) ), and $491 million (as restated (1) ) in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.

Patents, Trademarks, Copyrights and Licenses 

The Company currently holds rights to patents and copyrights relating to certain aspects of its computer systems, iPods, peripherals, software, and services. In addition, the Company has registered, and/or has applied to register, trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and a number of foreign countries for &#147;Apple,&#148; the Apple logo, &#147;Macintosh,&#148; &#147;iPod,&#148; &#147;iTunes,&#148; &#147;iTunes Store,&#148; and numerous other trademarks and service marks. Although the Company believes the ownership of such patents, copyrights, trademarks and service marks is an important factor in its business and that its success does depend in part on the ownership thereof, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence, and marketing abilities of its personnel. 

(1) &#160; See the &#147;Explanatory Note&#148; immediately preceding Part I, Item 1 and Note 2, &#147;Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements&#148; in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K.

Many of the Company&#146;s products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third-parties. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products and business methods, the Company believes, based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms; however, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained at all. Because of technological changes in the computer industry, current extensive patent coverage, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible certain components of the Company&#146;s products and business methods may unknowingly infringe existing patents of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third-parties. 

Foreign and Domestic Operations and Geographic Data 

The U.S. represents the Company&#146;s largest geographic marketplace. Approximately 60% of the Company&#146;s net sales in 2006 came from sales to customers inside the U.S. Final assembly of products sold by the Company is currently performed in the Company&#146;s manufacturing facility in Cork, Ireland, and by external vendors in Fremont, California; Fullerton, California; Taiwan; the Republic of Korea; the People&#146;s Republic of China; and the Czech Republic. Currently, manufacturing of many of the components used in the Company&#146;s products is performed by third-party vendors in Taiwan, China, Japan, Korea, and Singapore. Final assembly of substantially all of the Company&#146;s portable products, including MacBook Pros, MacBooks, and iPods, is performed by third-party vendors in China. Margins on sales of the Company&#146;s products in foreign countries, and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations, including tariffs and antidumping penalties. 

Information regarding financial data by geographic segment is set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements at Note 11, &#147;Segment Information and Geographic Data.&#148; 

Seasonal Business 

The Company has historically experienced increased net sales in its first and fourth fiscal quarters compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due to seasonal demand related to the holiday season and the beginning of the school year. This historical pattern should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Company&#146;s future net sales or financial performance. 

Warranty 

The Company offers a basic limited parts and labor warranty on its hardware products. The basic warranty period for hardware products is typically one year from the date of purchase by the end-user. The Company also offers a 90-day basic warranty for its service parts used to repair the Company&#146;s hardware products. In addition, consumers may purchase extended service coverage on most of the Company&#146;s hardware products in all of its major markets. 

Backlog 

In the Company&#146;s experience, the actual amount of product backlog at any particular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business prospects. In particular, backlog often increases in anticipation of or immediately following new product introductions as dealers anticipate shortages. Backlog is often reduced once dealers and customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply. Because of the foregoing, backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Company&#146;s ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance. 

Environmental Laws 

Compliance with federal, state, local, and foreign laws enacted for the protection of the environment has to date had no material effect on the Company&#146;s capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. In the future, these laws could have a material adverse effect on the Company. 

Production and marketing of products in certain states and countries may subject the Company to environmental and other regulations including, in some instances, the requirement to provide customers the ability to return product at the end of its useful life, and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the Company. Such laws and regulations have recently been passed in several jurisdictions in which the Company operates including various European Union member countries, Japan and certain states within the U.S. Although the Company does not anticipate any material adverse effects in the future based on the nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws, there is no assurance that such existing laws or future laws will not have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s financial condition, liquidity, or results of operations. 

Employees 

As of September 30, 2006, the Company had 17,787 full-time equivalent employees and an additional 2,399 temporary equivalent employees and contractors.

"
1A," Item 1A. Risk Factors 

Because of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company&#146;s operating results and financial condition, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. 

The matters relating to the investigation by the Special Committee of the Board of Directors and the restatement of the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements may result in additional litigation and governmental enforcement actions. 

On June 29, 2006, the Company announced that an internal review had discovered irregularities related to the issuance of certain stock option grants made between 1997 and 2001, including a grant to its Chief Executive Officer (&#147;CEO&#148;), Steve Jobs. The Company also announced a Special Committee of outside directors (&#147;Special Committee&#148;) had been formed and had hired independent counsel to conduct a full investigation of the Company&#146;s past stock option granting practices. As described in the Explanatory Note immediately preceding Part I, Item 1, and in Note 2 &#147;Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements&#148; in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K, as a result of the internal review and independent investigation, management has concluded, and the Audit and Finance Committee agrees, that incorrect measurement dates were used for financial accounting purposes for stock option grants made in 

certain prior periods. As a result, the Company has recorded additional non-cash stock-based compensation expense, and related tax effects, with regard to certain past stock option grants, and the Company has restated certain previously filed financial statements included in this Form 10-K. 

The internal review, the independent investigation, and related activities have required the Company to incur substantial expenses for legal, accounting, tax and other professional services, have diverted management&#146;s attention from the Company&#146;s business, and could in the future harm its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 

While the Company believes it has made appropriate judgments in determining the correct measurement dates for its stock option grants, the SEC may disagree with the manner in which the Company has accounted for and reported, or not reported, the financial impact. Accordingly, there is a risk the Company may have to further restate its prior financial statements, amend prior filings with the SEC, or take other actions not currently contemplated. 

The Company&#146;s past stock option granting practices and the restatement of prior financial statements have exposed the Company to greater risks associated with litigation, regulatory proceedings and government enforcement actions. As described in Part I, Item 3, &#147;Legal Proceedings&#148;, several derivative complaints and a class action complaint have been filed in state and federal courts against the Company&#146;s directors and certain of its executive officers pertaining to allegations relating to stock option grants. The Company has provided the results of its internal review and independent investigation to the SEC and the United States Attorney&#146;s Office for the Northern District of California, and in that regard the Company has responded to informal requests for documents and additional information. The Company intends to continue full cooperation. No assurance can be given regarding the outcomes from litigation, regulatory proceedings or government enforcement actions relating to the Company&#146;s past stock option practices. The resolution of these matters will be time consuming, expensive, and will distract management from the conduct of the Company&#146;s business. Furthermore, if the Company is subject to adverse findings in litigation, regulatory proceedings or government enforcement actions, the Company could be required to pay damages or penalties or have other remedies imposed, which could harm its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 

In August 2006, the Company received a NASDAQ Staff Determination letter stating that, as a result of the delayed filing of the Company&#146;s Form 10-Q for the quarter ended July 1, 2006 (the &#147;Third Quarter Form 10-Q&#148;), the Company was not in compliance with the filing requirements for continued listing as set forth in Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14) and was therefore subject to delisting from the NASDAQ Stock Market. On October 24, 2006, the NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Panel granted the Company&#146;s request for continued listing, subject to the Company filing the Third Quarter Form 10-Q, and any required restatements, with the SEC by December 29, 2006. On December 29, 2006, the Company filed the Third Quarter Form 10-Q with the SEC. With the filing of this Form 10-K, the Company believes that it has remedied its non-compliance with Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14), subject to NASDAQ&#146;s affirmative completion of its compliance protocols and its notification of the Company accordingly. However, if the SEC disagrees with the manner in which the Company has accounted for and reported, or not reported, the financial impact of past stock option grants, there could be further delays in filing subsequent SEC reports that might result in delisting of the Company&#146;s common stock from the NASDAQ Global Select Market. 

Unfavorable results of legal proceedings could adversely affect the Company&#146;s results of operations. 

The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that are discussed in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K. The Company is also subject to certain other legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and which have not been fully adjudicated. Results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. In addition, litigation may be disruptive to the Company&#146;s normal 

business operations. Should the Company fail to prevail in certain legal matters, the Company&#146;s financial condition, liquidity, or results of operations could be adversely affected. 

Economic conditions and political events could adversely affect the demand for the Company&#146;s products and the financial health of its suppliers, distributors, and resellers. 

The Company&#146;s operating performance depends significantly on economic conditions in the U.S. and abroad. At times in the past, demand for the Company&#146;s products has been negatively impacted by difficult global economic conditions. Uncertainty about future economic conditions makes it difficult to forecast future demand for the Company&#146;s products and related operating results. Should global and/or regional economic conditions deteriorate, demand for the Company&#146;s products could be adversely affected, as could the financial health of its suppliers, distributors, and resellers. 

War, terrorism, public health issues, and other circumstances could disrupt supply, delivery, or demand of products, which could negatively affect the Company&#146;s operations and performance. 

War, terrorism, public health issues, and other business interruptions, whether in the U.S. or abroad, have caused and could cause damage or disruption to international commerce and global economy, and thus may have a strong negative impact on the global economy, the Company, and the Company&#146;s suppliers or customers. The Company&#146;s major business operations are subject to interruption by earthquake, other natural disasters, fire, power shortages, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, labor disputes, public health issues, and other events beyond its control. The majority of the Company&#146;s research and development activities, its corporate headquarters, information technology systems, and other critical business operations, including certain component suppliers and manufacturing vendors, are located near major seismic faults. Because the Company does not carry earthquake insurance for direct quake-related losses, the Company&#146;s operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or other natural or man-made disaster. 

Although it is impossible to predict the occurrences or consequences of any such events, such events could result in a decrease in demand for the Company&#146;s products, make it difficult or impossible for the Company to deliver products to its customers or to receive components from its suppliers, and create delays and inefficiencies in the Company&#146;s supply chain. In addition, should major public health issues including pandemics arise, the Company could be negatively affected by more stringent employee travel restrictions, additional limitations in the availability of freight services, governmental actions limiting the movement of products between various regions, delays in production ramps of new products, and disruptions in the operations of the Company&#146;s manufacturing vendors and component suppliers. The Company&#146;s operating results and financial condition have been, and in the future may be, adversely affected by such events. 

The market for personal computers and related peripherals and services, as well as digital music devices and related services, is highly competitive. If the Company is unable to effectively compete in these markets, its results of operations could be adversely affected. 

The personal computer industry is highly competitive and is characterized by aggressive pricing practices, downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price/performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors, price sensitivity on the part of consumers, and a large number of competitors. Price competition in the market for personal computers and related peripherals has been particularly intense as competitors who sell Windows and Linux based personal computers have aggressively cut prices and lowered their product margins for personal computing products. The Company&#146;s results of operations and financial condition have been, and in the future may continue to be, adversely affected by these and other industry-wide pricing pressures and downward pressures on gross margins. 

The personal computer industry has also been characterized by rapid technological advances in software functionality, hardware performance, and features based on existing or emerging industry standards. Further, as the personal computer industry and its customers place more reliance on the Internet, an increasing number of Internet devices that are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers may compete for market share with the Company&#146;s existing products. Several competitors of the Company have targeted certain of the Company&#146;s key market segments, including consumer, education, professional and consumer digital video editing, and design and publishing. Several of the Company&#146;s competitors have introduced digital music products and/or online stores offering digital music distribution that mimic many of the unique design, technical features, and solutions of the Company&#146;s products. The Company has a significant number of competitors, many of whom have broader product lines and larger installed customer bases than those of the Company. Additionally, there has been a trend towards consolidation in the personal computer industry that has resulted in larger and potentially stronger competitors in the Company&#146;s markets. 

The Company is currently the only maker of hardware using the Mac OS. The Mac OS has a minority market share in the personal computer market, which is dominated by makers of computers utilizing competing operating systems, including Windows and Linux. The Company&#146;s future operating results and financial condition are substantially dependent on its ability to continue to develop improvements to the Macintosh platform to maintain perceived design and functional advantages over competing platforms. Additionally, if unauthorized copies of the Mac OS are used on other companies&#146; hardware products and result in decreased demand for the Company&#146;s hardware products, the Company&#146;s results of operations may be adversely affected. 

The Company is currently focused on market opportunities related to digital music distribution and related consumer electronic devices, including iPods. The Company faces significant competition from other companies promoting their own digital music products including MP3 players, music enabled cell phones, free peer-to-peer music and video services, and free streaming of digital content via the Internet. These competitors include both new entrants with different market approaches, such as subscription services models, and also larger companies that may have significant technical, marketing, distribution, and other resources, as well as established hardware, software, and digital content supplier relationships. Failure to effectively compete could negatively affect the Company&#146;s operating results and financial position. The Company expects competition in this space to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the Company&#146;s approach to tightly integrating these components within their individual offerings or work more collaboratively with each other to offer solutions that are more integrated than those they offer currently. Some of these current and potential competitors have substantial resources and may be able to provide such products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss to compete with the Company&#146;s offerings. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that effectively compete in these markets. The Company may also have to respond to price competition by lowering prices and/or increasing features which could adversely affect the Company&#146;s music product gross margins as well as overall Company gross margins. 

The Company also faces significant competition in the U.S. education market. U.S. elementary and secondary schools, as well as college and university customers, remain a core market for the Company. In an effort to gain market share and remain competitive, the Company will continue to pursue one-to-one (1:1) learning solutions in education. 1:1 learning solutions typically consist of a portable computer for every student and teacher along with the installation of a wireless network . These 1:1 learning solutions and other strategic sales are generally priced more aggressively and could result in significantly less profitability or financial losses, particularly for larger deals. Although the Company believes it has taken certain steps to strengthen its position in the education market, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to increase or maintain its share of the education market or execute profitably on large strategic 

arrangements. Failure to do so may have an adverse impact on the Company&#146;s operating results and financial condition. 

Future operating results are dependent upon the Company&#146;s ability to obtain a sufficient supply of components, including microprocessors, some of which are in short supply or available only from limited sources. 

Although most components essential to the Company&#146;s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain key components including microprocessors and ASICs are currently obtained by the Company from single or limited sources. Some key components (including without limitation DRAM, NAND flash-memory, and TFT-LCD flat-panel displays), while currently available to the Company from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide availability and pricing pressures. In addition, new products introduced by the Company often initially utilize custom components obtained from only one source until the Company has evaluated whether there is a need for, and subsequently qualifies, additional suppliers. In situations where a component or product utilizes new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until such time as the suppliers&#146; yields have matured. The Company and other producers in the personal computer and consumer electronics industries also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. The Company uses some components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer or consumer electronics industries. Continued availability of these components may be affected if producers decided to concentrate on the production of components other than those customized to meet the Company&#146;s requirements. If the supply of a key component were delayed or constrained on a new or existing product, the Company&#146;s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. 

The Company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and transitions to remain competitive and effectively stimulate customer demand. 

Due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the personal computer and consumer electronics industries, which are characterized by dynamic customer demand patterns and rapid technological advances, the Company must continually introduce new products and technologies, enhance existing products to remain competitive, and effectively stimulate customer demand for new products and upgraded versions of the Company&#146;s existing products. The success of new product introductions is dependent on a number of factors, including market acceptance; the Company&#146;s ability to manage the risks associated with product transitions, including the transition to Intel-based Macintosh computers, and production ramp issues; the availability of application software for new products; the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand; the availability of products in appropriate quantities and costs to meet anticipated demand; and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects in the early stages of introduction. Accordingly, the Company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect new products will have on its sales or results of operations. 

In June 2005, the Company announced its plan to begin using Intel microprocessors in its computers. During 2006, the Company introduced new Intel-based models of the MacBook Pro, MacBook, Mac Pro, iMac, and Mac mini computers. The Company&#146;s transition to Intel microprocessors for Macintosh systems was completed in August 2006, and its transition for Xserve was completed in November 2006. This transition has been and will continue to be subject to numerous risks and uncertainties including the timely innovation and delivery of related hardware and software products to support Intel microprocessors, market acceptance of Intel-based Macintosh computers, and the development and availability on acceptable terms of components and services essential to enable the Company to timely deliver Intel-based Macintosh computers. In addition, the Company is dependent on third-party software developers such as Microsoft and Adobe to timely develop current and future applications that run on Intel-based Macintosh computers. Universal versions of Microsoft Office and Adobe&#146;s Creative Suite applications are not currently available. Additionally, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to maintain its 

historical gross margin percentages on its products, including Intel-based Macintosh computers, which may adversely impact the Company&#146;s results of operations. 

The Company&#146;s products from time to time experience quality problems that can result in decreased net sales and operating profits. 

The Company sells highly complex hardware and software products that can contain defects in design and manufacture. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those sold by the Company, often contain &#147;bugs&#148; that can unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the software. Defects may also occur in components and products the Company purchases from third-parties. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware and software it sells. Failure to do so could result in lost revenue, loss of reputation, and significant warranty and other expense to remedy. 

Because orders for components, and in some cases commitments to purchase components, must be placed in advance of customer orders, the Company faces substantial inventory risk. 

The Company records a write-down for inventories of components and products that have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues necessary reserves for cancellation fees for orders of products and components that have been cancelled. Although the Company believes its inventory and related provisions are currently adequate, given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the computer and consumer electronics industries and the transition to Intel-based Macintosh computers, no assurance can be given that the Company will not incur additional inventory and related charges. In addition, such charges have had, and may have, a material effect on the Company&#146;s financial position and results of operations. 

The Company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments. Because the Company&#146;s markets are volatile and subject to rapid technology and price changes, and because of the transition to Intel-based Macintosh computers, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and produce or order from third parties excess or insufficient inventories of particular products. Consistent with industry practice, components are normally acquired through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. Such purchase commitments typically cover the Company&#146;s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. The Company&#146;s operating results and financial condition have been in the past and may in the future be materially adversely affected by the Company&#146;s ability to manage its inventory levels and respond to short-term shifts in customer demand patterns. 

The Company is dependent on manufacturing and logistics services provided by third parties, many of whom are located outside of the U.S. 

Most of the Company&#146;s products are manufactured in whole or in part by third-party manufacturers. In addition, the Company has outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While outsourcing arrangements may lower the cost of operations, they also reduce the Company&#146;s direct control over production and distribution. It is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of the products manufactured or services rendered, or the flexibility of the Company to respond to changing market conditions. In addition, the Company is reliant on third-party manufacturers to adhere to the Company&#146;s supplier code of conduct. Moreover, although arrangements with such manufacturers may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the Company may remain at least initially responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects. Any unanticipated product defect or warranty liability, whether pursuant to arrangements with contract manufacturers or otherwise, could adversely affect the Company&#146;s future operating results and financial condition. 

Final assembly of products sold by the Company is currently performed in the Company&#146;s manufacturing facility in Cork, Ireland, and by external vendors in Fremont, California; Fullerton, California; Taiwan; the Republic of Korea; the People&#146;s Republic of China; and the Czech Republic. Currently, manufacturing of many of the components used in the Company&#146;s products is performed by third-party vendors in Taiwan, China, Japan, Korea, and Singapore. Final assembly of substantially all of the Company&#146;s portable products, including MacBook Pros, MacBooks, and iPods, is performed by third-party vendors in China. If for any reason manufacturing or logistics in any of these locations is disrupted by regional economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues, or due to information technology system failures or military actions, the Company&#146;s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. 

The Company&#146;s future operating performance is dependent on the performance of distributors and other resellers of the Company&#146;s products. 

The Company distributes its products through wholesalers, resellers, national and regional retailers, and cataloguers, many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers. In addition, the Company sells many of its products and resells certain third-party products in most of its major markets directly to end-users, certain education customers, and certain resellers through its online stores around the world and its retail stores. Many of the Company&#146;s resellers operate on narrow product margins and have been negatively impacted in the past by weak economic conditions. Considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral or credit insurance are outstanding with the Company&#146;s distribution and retail channel partners. The Company&#146;s business and financial results could be adversely affected if the financial condition of these resellers weakens, if resellers within consumer channels were to cease distribution of the Company&#146;s products, or if uncertainty regarding demand for the Company&#146;s products caused resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company&#146;s products. The Company has invested and will continue to invest in various programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers&#146; stores with Company employees and contractors. These programs could require a substantial investment from the Company, while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue to offset this investment. 

Over the past several years, an increasing proportion of the Company&#146;s net sales have been made by the Company directly to end-users through its online stores around the world and through its retail stores in the U.S., Canada, Japan, and the U.K. Some of the Company&#146;s resellers have perceived this expansion of the Company&#146;s direct sales as conflicting with their own businesses and economic interests as distributors and resellers of the Company&#146;s products. Perception of such a conflict could discourage the Company&#146;s resellers from investing additional resources in the distribution and sale of the Company&#146;s products or lead them to limit or cease distribution of the Company&#146;s products. The Company&#146;s business and financial results could be adversely affected if expansion of its direct sales to end-users causes some or all of its resellers to cease or limit distribution of the Company&#146;s products. 

The Company relies on third-party digital content, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all. 

The Company contracts with third parties to offer their digital content to customers through the Company&#146;s iTunes Store. The Company pays substantial fees to obtain the rights to offer to its customers this third-party digital content. The Company&#146;s licensing arrangements with these third-party content providers are short-term in nature and do not guarantee the future renewal of these arrangements at commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Certain parties in the music industry have consolidated and formed alliances, which could limit the availability and increase the fees required to offer digital content to customers through the iTunes Store. Some third-party content providers currently or may in the future offer music products and services that compete with the Company&#146;s music products and services, and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the Company to license their digital content in the future. Further, other distributors of third-party content or third-party content owners may seek to limit 

the Company&#146;s access to or increase the total cost of such content. If the Company is unable to continue to offer a wide variety of digital content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules, or continue to expand its geographic reach outside the U.S., then sales and gross margins of the Company&#146;s iTunes Store, as well as related hardware and peripherals, including iPods, may be adversely affected. 

Third-party content providers and artists require that the Company provide certain digital rights management (&#147;DRM&#148;) solutions and other security mechanisms. If the requirements from content providers or artists change, then the Company may be required to further develop or license technology to address such new rights and requirements. In addition, certain countries have passed legislation or may propose legislation that would force the Company to license its DRM solutions so that content would be interoperable with competitor devices, which could lessen the protection of content subjecting it to piracy and could affect arrangements with the Company&#146;s content suppliers. There is no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner, if at all, which could have a materially adverse effect on the Company&#146;s operating results and financial position. 

The Company&#146;s future performance is dependent upon support from third-party software developers. If third-party software applications cease to be developed or available for the Company&#146;s hardware products, then customers may choose not to buy the Company&#146;s products. 

The Company believes decisions by customers to purchase the Company&#146;s personal computers, as opposed to Windows-based systems, are often based on the availability of third-party software applications such as Microsoft Office. The Company also believes the availability of third-party application software for the Company&#146;s hardware products depends in part on third-party developers&#146; perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining, and upgrading such software for the Company&#146;s products versus software for the larger Windows market or growing Linux market. This analysis may be based on factors such as the perceived strength of the Company and its products, the anticipated potential revenue that may be generated, continued acceptance by customers of Mac OS X, and the costs of developing such software products. To the extent the minority market share held by the Company in the personal computer market has caused software developers to question the Company&#146;s prospects in the personal computer market, developers could be less inclined to develop new application software or upgrade existing software for the Company&#146;s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger Windows market or growing Linux market. The Company&#146;s recent announcement that it plans to add a feature to the next version of Mac OS X that will enable Intel-based Macintosh systems to run Windows XP may deter developers from creating software applications for Mac OS X if such applications are available for the Windows platform. Moreover, there can be no assurance software developers will continue to develop software for Mac OS X on a timely basis or at all. 

In June 2005, the Company announced its plan to begin using Intel microprocessors in its computers. During 2006, the Company introduced new Intel-based models of the MacBook Pro, MacBook, Mac Pro, iMac, and Mac mini computers. The Company&#146;s transition to Intel microprocessors for Macintosh systems was completed in August 2006, and its transition for Xserve was completed in November 2006. The Company depends on third-party software developers to timely develop current and future applications that run on Intel microprocessors. Universal versions of Microsoft Office and Adobe&#146;s Creative Suite applications are not currently available. The lack of applications that run on Intel-based Macintosh systems, including Microsoft Office and Adobe Creative Suite, could have a materially adverse effect on the Company&#146;s operating results and financial position. 

In addition, past and future development by the Company of its own software applications and solutions may negatively impact the decision of software developers, such as Microsoft and Adobe, to develop, maintain, and upgrade similar or competitive software for the Company&#146;s products. The Company currently markets and sells a variety of software applications for use by professionals, consumers, and education customers that could influence the decisions of third-party software developers to develop or 

upgrade Macintosh-compatible software products. Software applications currently marketed by the Company include software for professional film and video editing, professional compositing and visual effects for large format film and video productions, professional music production and music post production, professional and consumer DVD encoding and authoring, professional digital photo editing and workflow management, consumer digital video and digital photo editing and management, digital music management, desktop-based database management, word processing, and high-quality presentations. Discontinuance of third-party software products for the Macintosh platform could have an adverse effect on the Company&#146;s net sales and results of operations. 

The Company&#146;s business relies on access to patents and intellectual property obtained from third parties, and the Company&#146;s future results could be adversely affected if it is alleged or found to have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others. 

Many of the Company&#146;s products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third parties. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products and business methods, the Company believes that based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available or available on acceptable terms. 

Because of technological changes in the computer and consumer electronics industries, current extensive patent coverage, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible certain components of the Company&#146;s products and business methods may unknowingly infringe existing patents of others. The Company has from time to time been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of others. Responding to such claims, regardless of their merit, can be time-consuming, result in significant expenses, and cause the diversion of management and technical personnel. Several pending claims are in various stages of evaluation. The Company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements in certain of these cases. However, no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. In the event there is a temporary or permanent injunction entered prohibiting the Company from marketing or selling certain of its products or a successful claim of infringement against the Company requiring it to pay royalties to a third-party, the Company&#146;s future operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. Information regarding certain claims and litigation involving the Company related to alleged patent infringement and other matters is set forth in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K. In the opinion of management, the Company does not have a potential liability for damages or royalties from any current legal proceedings or claims related to the infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights of others that would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial condition. However, the results of such legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Should the Company fail to prevail in any of the matters related to infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights of others described in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K or should several of these matters be resolved against the Company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected. 

The Company&#146;s retail initiative has required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. 

Through September 30, 2006, the Company had opened 165 retail stores. The Company&#146;s retail initiative has required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory, and personnel. The Company has also entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space with lease terms ranging from 5 to 20 years, the majority of which are for 10 years. The Company could incur substantial costs should it choose to terminate these commitments or close individual stores. Such costs could adversely affect the Company&#146;s results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, a relatively high proportion of the Retail segment&#146;s costs are fixed because of personnel costs, 

depreciation of store construction costs, and lease expense. As a result, significant losses would result should the Retail segment experience a significant decline in sales for any reason. 

Certain of the Company&#146;s stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues that function as vehicles for general corporate marketing, corporate events, and brand awareness. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment in equipment and leasehold improvements than the Company&#146;s more typical retail stores. The Company has opened eight such stores through September 2006. Because of their location and size, these high-profile stores also require the Company to enter into substantially larger operating lease commitments compared to those required for its more typical stores. Current leases on such locations have terms ranging from 10 to 14 years with total remaining commitments per location ranging from $4 million to $33 million. Closure or poor performance of one of these high-profile stores could have a significant negative impact on the Company&#146;s results of operations and financial condition. 

Many of the general risks and uncertainties the Company faces could also have an adverse impact on its Retail segment. Also, many factors unique to retail operations present risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond the Company&#146;s control, that could adversely affect the Retail segment&#146;s future results, cause its actual results to differ from those currently expected, and/or have an adverse effect on the Company&#146;s consolidated results of operations. Potential risks and uncertainties unique to retail operations that could have an adverse impact on the Retail segment include, among other things, macro-economic factors that have a negative impact on general retail activity; inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation; inability to sell third-party hardware and software products at adequate margins; failure to manage relationships with existing retail channel partners; lack of experience in managing retail operations outside the U.S.; costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of Apple-branded and third-party retail inventory; and inability to obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost. 

Investment in new business strategies and initiatives could disrupt the Company&#146;s ongoing business and may present risks not originally contemplated. 

The Company has and may in the future invest in new business strategies or engage in acquisitions that complement the Company&#146;s strategic direction and product roadmap. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management&#146;s attention away from current business operations; insufficient revenue generation to offset liabilities assumed and expenses associated with the strategy; and unidentified issues not discovered in the Company&#146;s due diligence process. Because these new ventures are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that such strategies and initiatives will be successful and will not materially adversely affect the Company&#146;s business, operating results or financial condition. 

Declines in the sales of the Company&#146;s professional products, software, accessories, or service and support contracts, or increases in sales of consumer products, including iPods, may negatively impact the Company&#146;s gross margin and operating margin percentages. 

The Company&#146;s professional products, including MacBook Pro and Mac Pro systems, software, accessories, and service and support contracts, generally have higher gross margins than the Company&#146;s consumer products, including the iMac, Mac mini, MacBook, iPod, and content from the iTunes Store. A shift in sales mix away from higher margin professional products towards lower margin consumer products could adversely affect the Company&#146;s future gross margin and operating margin percentages. The Company&#146;s traditional professional customers may choose to buy consumer products, specifically the iMac and MacBook, instead of professional products. Professional users may choose to buy the iMac due to its relative price performance and unique design featuring a flat panel screen. Professional users may also choose to purchase MacBooks instead of the Company&#146;s professional-oriented portable products due to their price performance and screen size. Additionally, significant future growth in iPod sales without 

corresponding growth in higher margin product sales could also reduce gross margin and operating margin percentages. 

The Company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate for a variety of reasons. 

The Company&#146;s profit margins vary among its products and its distribution channels. The Company&#146;s direct sales, primarily through its retail and online stores, generally have higher associated profitability than its indirect sales. As a result, the Company&#146;s gross margin and operating margin percentages, as well as overall profitability may be adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product, geographic or channel mix, or new product announcements, including the transition to Intel-based Macintosh computers. In addition, the Company generally sells more product during the third month of each quarter than it does during either of the first two months, a pattern typical in the personal computer and consumer electronics industries. This sales pattern can produce pressure on the Company&#146;s internal infrastructure during the third month of a quarter and may adversely impact the Company&#146;s ability to predict its financial results accurately. Furthermore, the Company has typically experienced greater net sales in the first and fourth fiscal quarters compared to other quarters in the fiscal year due to seasonal demand related to the holiday season and the beginning of the school year. Developments late in a quarter, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company&#146;s products, an internal systems failure, or failure of one of the Company&#146;s key logistics, components suppliers, or manufacturing partners, could have significant adverse impacts on the Company and its results of operations and financial condition. 

The Company has higher research and development and selling, general and administrative costs, as a percentage of revenue, than many of its competitors. 

The Company&#146;s ability to compete successfully and maintain attractive gross margins and revenue growth is heavily dependent upon its ability to ensure a continuing and timely flow of innovative and competitive products and technologies to the marketplace. As a result, the Company generally incurs higher research and development costs as a percentage of revenue than its competitors who sell personal computers based on other operating systems. Many of these competitors seek to compete aggressively on price and maintain very low cost structures. Further, as a result of the expansion of the Company&#146;s Retail segment and costs associated with marketing the Company&#146;s brand including its unique operating system, the Company incurs higher selling costs as a percentage of revenue than many of its competitors. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive gross margins, its results of operations may be materially adversely affected by its operating cost structure. 

The Company is exposed to credit risk on its accounts receivable and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements. This risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen. 

The Company distributes its products through third-party computer resellers and retailers and directly to certain educational institutions and commercial customers. A substantial majority of the Company&#146;s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral or credit insurance. The Company also has unsecured non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale by the Company of raw material components to these manufacturing vendors who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has entered into long-term supply agreements to secure supply of NAND flash-memory and has prepaid a total of $1.25 billion under these agreements. While the Company has procedures in place to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and non-trade receivables as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will be effective in limiting its credit risk and avoiding losses. Additionally, if the global economy or regional economies deteriorate, the Company would be more likely to incur a material loss or losses as a result of the weakening financial condition of one or more of its customers or manufacturing vendors. 

The Company&#146;s success depends largely on its ability to attract and retain key personnel. 

Much of the future success of the Company depends on the continued service and availability of skilled personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, members of its executive team, and those in technical, marketing and staff positions. Experienced personnel in the information technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in the Silicon Valley, where the majority of the Company&#146;s key employees are located. The Company has relied on its ability to grant stock options as one mechanism for recruiting and retaining this highly skilled talent. Recent accounting regulations requiring the expensing of stock options have resulted in increased stock-based compensation expense, which may cause the Company to reduce the amount of stock-based awards issued to employees. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to successfully attract and retain key personnel. 

The Company is subject to risks associated with the availability and coverage of insurance. 

For certain risks, the Company does not maintain insurance coverage because of cost and/or availability. Because the Company retains some portion of its insurable risks, and in some cases self insures completely, unforeseen or catastrophic losses in excess of insured limits may have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s results of operations and financial position. 

Failure of information technology systems and breaches in the security of data upon which the Company relies could adversely affect the Company&#146;s future operating results. 

Information technology system failures and breaches of data security could disrupt the Company&#146;s ability to function in the normal course of business by potentially causing delays or cancellation of customer orders, impeding the manufacture or shipment of products, or resulting in the unintentional disclosure of customer or Company information. Management has taken steps to address these concerns for its own systems by implementing sophisticated network security and internal control measures. However, there can be no assurance that a system failure or data security breach of the Company or a third-party vendor will not have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s results of operations. 

The Company&#146;s business is subject to the risks of international operations. 

A large portion of the Company&#146;s revenue is derived from its international operations. As a result, the Company&#146;s operating results and financial condition could be significantly affected by risks associated with international activities, including economic and labor conditions, political instability, tax laws (including U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiaries), and changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus the local currency in which the products are sold and goods and services are purchased. The Company&#146;s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relate to non-U.S. dollar denominated sales in Europe, Japan, Australia, Canada, and certain parts of Asia and non-dollar denominated operating expenses incurred throughout the world. Weaknesses in foreign currencies, particularly the Japanese Yen and the Euro, can adversely impact consumer demand for the Company&#146;s products and the U.S. dollar value of the Company&#146;s foreign currency denominated sales. Conversely, a strengthening in these and other foreign currencies can cause the Company to modify international pricing and affect the value of the Company&#146;s foreign denominated sales, and in some cases, may also increase the cost to the Company of some product components. 

Margins on sales of the Company&#146;s products in foreign countries, and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations, including tariffs and antidumping penalties. 

Derivative instruments, such as foreign exchange forward and option positions have been utilized by the Company to hedge exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates. 

Further information related to the Company&#146;s global market risks may be found in Part II, Item 7A of this Form 10-K under the subheading &#147;Foreign Currency Risk&#148; and may be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K at Notes 1 and 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

The Company is subject to risks associated with environmental regulations. 

Production and marketing of products in certain states and countries may subject the Company to environmental and other regulations including, in some instances, the requirement to provide customers the ability to return product at the end of its useful life, and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the Company. Such laws and regulations have recently been passed in several jurisdictions in which the Company operates, including various European Union member countries, Japan and certain states within the U.S. Although the Company does not anticipate any material adverse effects in the future based on the nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws, there is no assurance such existing laws or future laws will not have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s financial condition, liquidity, or results of operations. 

Changes in accounting rules could affect the Company&#146;s future operating results. 

Financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. These principles are subject to interpretation by various governing bodies, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) and the SEC, who create and interpret appropriate accounting standards. A change from current accounting standards could have a significant effect on the Company&#146;s results of operations. In December 2004, the FASB issued new guidance that addresses the accounting for share-based payments, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (&#147;SFAS&#148;) No. 123 (revised 2004) (&#147;SFAS No. 123R&#148;), Share-Based Payment , which the Company adopted in 2006. In 2006, stock-based compensation expense reduced diluted earnings per common share by approximately $0.14. Although the adoption of SFAS No. 123R is expected to continue to have a significant impact on the Company&#146;s results of operations, future changes to various assumptions used to determine the fair-value of awards issued or the amount and type of equity awards granted create uncertainty as to the amount of future stock-based compensation expense. 

Changes in the Company&#146;s tax rates could affect its future results. 

The Company&#146;s future effective tax rates could be favorably or unfavorably affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of the Company&#146;s deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws or their interpretation. In addition, the Company is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on the Company&#146;s results of operations and financial condition. 

The Company&#146;s stock price may be volatile. 

The Company&#146;s stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility as a result of variations between its actual and anticipated financial results and as a result of announcements by the Company and its competitors. The stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that may have been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. Furthermore, the Company believes its stock price reflects high future growth and profitability expectations. If the Company fails to meet these expectations its stock price may significantly decline. In addition, increases in the Company&#146;s stock price may result in greater dilution of earnings per share.

7A," Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

Interest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management 

The Company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and its interest rate swap and option positions, both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures. However, given the effective horizons of the Company&#146;s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures, there can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates. In addition, the timing of the accounting for recognition of gains and losses related to mark-to-market instruments for any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Company&#146;s operating results and financial position. 

Interest Rate Risk 

While the Company is exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world&#146;s leading industrialized countries, the Company&#146;s interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of U.S. interest rates. In this regard, changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company&#146;s cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments as well as costs associated with foreign currency hedges. 

The Company&#146;s short-term investment policy and strategy is to ensure the preservation of capital, meet liquidity requirements, and optimize return in light of the current credit and interest rate environment. A portion of the Company&#146;s cash is managed by external managers within the guidelines of the Company&#146;s investment policy and to an objective market benchmark. The Company&#146;s internal portfolio is benchmarked against external manager performance, allowing for differences in liquidity needs. 

The Company&#146;s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company&#146;s investment portfolio. The Company places its short-term investments in highly liquid securities issued by high credit quality issuers and, by policy, limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The Company&#146;s general policy is to limit the risk of principal loss and ensure the safety of invested funds by limiting market and credit risk. All highly liquid investments with initial maturities of three months or less are classified as cash equivalents; highly liquid investments with initial maturities greater than three months are classified as short-term investments. As of September 30, 2006, approximately $921 million of the Company&#146;s short-term investments had underlying maturities ranging from 1 to 5 years. As of September 24, 2005, $287 million of the Company&#146;s short-term investments had underlying maturities ranging from 1 to 5 years. The remainder all had underlying maturities of less than 12 months. The Company may sell its investments prior to their stated maturities for strategic purposes, in anticipation of credit deterioration or for duration management. The Company recognized net losses before taxes of $434,000 and $137,000 in 2006 and 2005, respectively, and a net gain before taxes of $1 million in 2004 as a result of such sales. 

To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the Company&#146;s investment portfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of September 30, 2006, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $15.2 million decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. As of September 24, 2005, a similar 100 basis point shift in the yield curve would have resulted in a $19.9 million decline in fair value. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity. 

Foreign Currency Risk 

In general, the Company is a net receiver of foreign currencies. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, may negatively affect the Company&#146;s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is also a risk the Company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. 

The Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows, and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. Generally, the Company&#146;s practice is to hedge a majority of its existing material foreign exchange transaction exposures. However, the Company may not hedge certain foreign exchange transaction exposures due to immateriality, prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures, and limited availability of appropriate hedging instruments. 

To provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Company&#146;s foreign currency derivative positions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (&#147;VAR&#148;) model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo simulation to generate 3,000 random market price paths. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company&#146;s foreign exchange portfolio due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. The model assumes normal market conditions. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments, and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates with 95% confidence a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $9.2 million as of September 30, 2006 compared to a maximum one-day loss of $10.0 million as of September 24, 2005. Because the Company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, losses incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures. 

Actual future gains and losses associated with the Company&#146;s investment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of September 30, 2006 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the changes in the timing and amount of interest rates, foreign currency exchanges rates, and the Company&#146;s actual exposures and positions.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Note 1&#151;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

Apple Computer, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (the Company) designs, manufactures, and markets personal computers and related software, services, peripherals, and networking solutions. The Company also designs, develops, and markets a line of portable digital music players along with related accessories and services including the online sale of third-party audio and video products. The Company sells its products worldwide through its online stores, its retail stores, its direct sales force, and third-party wholesalers, resellers, and value-added resellers. In addition, the Company sells a variety of third-party Macintosh and iPod compatible products including application software, printers, storage devices, speakers, headphones, and various other accessories and supplies through its online and retail stores. The Company sells to education, consumer, creative professional, business, and government customers. 

Basis of Presentation and Preparation 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior year amounts in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. 

Typically, the Company&#146;s fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of September. Fiscal years 2005 and 2004 were each 52-week years. However, approximately every six years, the Company reports a 53-week fiscal year to align its fiscal quarters with calendar quarters by adding a week to its first fiscal quarter. The Company added this additional week in the first fiscal quarter of its fiscal year 2006. All information presented herein is based on the Company&#146;s fiscal calendar. 

Common Stock Split 

On February 28, 2005, the Company effected a two-for-one stock split to shareholders of record as of February 18, 2005. All share and per share information has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split. 

Financial Instruments 

Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments 

All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents. Highly liquid investments with maturities greater than three months at the date of purchase are classified as short-term investments. The Company&#146;s debt and marketable equity securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. Management determines the appropriate classification of its investments in debt and marketable equity securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates the available-for-sale designations as of each balance sheet date. These securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a component of shareholders&#146; equity. The cost of securities sold is based upon the specific identification method. 

Derivative Financial Instruments 

The Company accounts for its derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and carries them at fair value. Derivatives that are not defined as hedges in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (&#147;SFAS&#148;) No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended, must be adjusted to fair value through earnings. If the derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

Note 1&#151;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 

changes in fair value will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through earnings, or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. 

For derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that are designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders&#146; equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recognized in current earnings. To receive hedge accounting treatment, cash flow hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to expected future cash flows on hedged transactions. For derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability and that are designated as fair value hedges, the net gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings in the current period. The net gain or loss on the effective portion of a derivative instrument that is designated as an economic hedge of the foreign currency translation exposure of the net investment in a foreign operation is reported in the same manner as a foreign currency translation adjustment. For forward contracts designated as net investment hedges, the Company excludes changes in fair value relating to changes in the forward carry component from its definition of effectiveness. Accordingly, any gains or losses related to this component are recognized in current earnings. 

Inventories 

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, computed using the first-in, first-out method, or market. If the cost of the inventories exceeds their market value, provisions are made currently for the difference between the cost and the market value. The Company&#146;s inventories consist primarily of finished goods for all periods presented. 

Property, Plant, and Equipment 

Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed by use of the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which for buildings is the lesser of 30 years or the remaining life of the underlying building, up to 5 years for equipment, and the shorter of lease terms or 10 years for leasehold improvements. The Company capitalizes eligible costs to acquire or develop internal-use software that are incurred subsequent to the preliminary project stage. Capitalized costs related to internal-use software are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from 3 to 5 years. Depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment was $180 million, $141 million, and $126 million during 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. 

Asset Retirement Obligations 

The Company records obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs in accordance with SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations . The Company reviews legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and/or normal use of the assets. If it is determined that a legal obligation exists, the fair value of the liability for an asset retirement obligation is recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset. The difference between the gross expected future cash flow and its 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

Note 1&#151;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 

present value is accreted over the life of the related lease as an operating expense. All of the Company&#146;s existing asset retirement obligations are associated with commitments to return property subject to operating leases to original condition upon lease termination. 

The following table reconciles changes in the Company&#146;s asset retirement liabilities for fiscal 2006 and 2005 (in millions):

Long-Lived Assets Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets 

The Company reviews property, plant, and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles, excluding goodwill, for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If property, plant, and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair market value. For the three fiscal years ended September 30, 2006, the Company had no material impairment of its long-lived assets, except for the impairment of certain assets in connection with the restructuring actions described in Note 6 of these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives should not be amortized but rather be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that they may be impaired. The Company performs its goodwill impairment tests on or about August 30 of each year. The Company did not recognize any goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges in 2006, 2005, or 2004. The Company established reporting units based on its current reporting structure. For purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, goodwill has been allocated to these reporting units to the extent it relates to each reporting unit. 

SFAS No. 142 also requires that intangible assets with definite lives be amortized over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144. The Company is currently amortizing its acquired intangible assets with definite lives over periods ranging from 3 to 10 years. 

Foreign Currency Translation 

The Company translates the assets and liabilities of its international non-U.S. functional currency subsidiaries into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of each period. Revenue and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. Gains and losses from these translations are credited or charged to foreign currency translation

included in &#147;accumulated other comprehensive income&#148; in shareholders&#146; equity. The Company&#146;s foreign manufacturing subsidiaries and certain other international subsidiaries that use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency remeasure monetary assets and liabilities at exchange rates in effect at the end of each period, and inventories, property, and nonmonetary assets and liabilities at historical rates. Gains and losses from these translations were insignificant and have been included in the Company&#146;s results of operations. 

Revenue Recognition 

Net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, peripherals, digital content, and service and support contracts. The Company recognizes revenue pursuant to applicable accounting standards, including American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position (&#147;SOP&#148;) No. 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition , as amended, and Securities and Exchange Commission (&#147;SEC&#148;) Staff Accounting Bulletin (&#147;SAB&#148;) No. 104, Revenue Recognition . 

The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred. For most of the Company&#146;s product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company legally retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. If at the outset of an arrangement the Company determines the arrangement fee is not, or is presumed not to be, fixed or determinable, revenue is deferred and subsequently recognized as amounts become due and payable. 

Revenue from service and support contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the service coverage periods. These contracts typically include extended phone support, repair services, web-based support resources, diagnostic tools, and extend the service coverage offered under the Company&#146;s one-year limited warranty. 

The Company sells software and peripheral products obtained from other companies. The Company establishes its own pricing and retains related inventory risk, is the primary obligor in sales transactions with its customers, and assumes the credit risk for amounts billed to its customers. Accordingly, the Company recognizes revenue for the sale of products obtained from other companies based on the gross amount billed. 

Revenue on arrangements that include multiple elements such as hardware, software, and services is allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each element. Each element&#146;s allocated revenue is recognized when revenue recognition criteria for that element have been met. Fair value is generally determined by vendor specific objective evidence (&#147;VSOE&#148;), which is based on the price charged when each element is sold separately. If the Company cannot objectively determine the fair value of any undelivered element included in a multiple-element arrangement, the Company defers revenue until all elements are delivered and services have been performed, or until fair value can objectively be determined for any remaining undelivered elements. When the fair value of a delivered element has not been established, the Company uses the residual method to recognize revenue if the fair value of all undelivered elements is determinable. Under the residual method, the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements and is recognized as revenue.

Note 1&#151;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 

The Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive programs, including reseller and end-user rebates, and other sales programs and volume-based incentives. The estimated cost of these programs is accrued as a reduction to revenue in the period the Company has sold the product and committed to a plan. The Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the Company&#146;s historical experience. 

Generally, the Company does not offer specified or unspecified upgrade rights to its customers in connection with software sales or the sale of extended warranty and support contracts. When the Company does offer specified upgrade rights, the Company defers revenue for the fair value of the specified upgrade right until the future obligation is fulfilled or when the right to the specified upgrade expires. Additionally, a limited number of the Company&#146;s software products are available with maintenance agreements that grant customers rights to unspecified future upgrades over the maintenance term on a when and if available basis. Revenue associated with such maintenance is recognized ratably over the maintenance term. 

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 

The Company records its allowance for doubtful accounts based upon its assessment of various factors. The Company considers historical experience, the age of the accounts receivable balances, credit quality of the Company&#146;s customers, current economic conditions, and other factors that may affect customers&#146; ability to pay. 

Shipping Costs 

For all periods presented, amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as revenue, and the Company&#146;s shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales. 

Warranty Expense 

The Company provides for the estimated cost of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. The Company assesses the adequacy of its preexisting warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual experience and changes in future estimates. 

Software Development Costs 

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Development costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed are subject to capitalization beginning when a product&#146;s technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to customers pursuant to SFAS No. 86, Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed . In most instances, the Company&#146;s products are released soon after technological feasibility has been established. Therefore, costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility are usually not significant, and generally all software development costs have been immediately expensed. 

In 2004, the Company began incurring substantial development costs associated with Mac OS X version 10.4 Tiger (&#147;Tiger&#148;) subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility as evidenced by public demonstration in August 2004 and the subsequent release of a developer beta version of the product. The Company capitalized approximately $29.7 million and $4.5 million during 2005 and 2004, respectively, of costs associated with the development of Tiger. In accordance with SFAS No. 86, amortization of this asset to cost of sales began in April 2005 when the Company began shipping Tiger and is being recognized on a straight-line basis over a three-year estimated useful life.

Note 1&#151;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 

During 2004, the Company incurred substantial development costs associated with FileMaker Pro 7 subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility as evidenced by public demonstration and release of a developer beta version, and prior to the release of the final version of the product in March 2004. Therefore, during 2004, the Company capitalized approximately $2.3 million of costs associated with the development of FileMaker Pro 7. In accordance with SFAS No. 86, amortization of this asset to cost of sales began in March 2004 when the Company began shipping FileMaker Pro 7 and is being recognized on a straight-line basis over a three-year estimated useful life. 

Total amortization related to capitalized software development costs was $17.8 million, $15.7 million, and $10.7 million in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. 

Advertising Costs 

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $338 million, $287 million, and $206 million for 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. 

Stock-Based Compensation 

On September 25, 2005, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) (&#147;SFAS No. 123R&#148;), Share-Based Payment , which addresses the accounting for stock-based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for (a) equity instruments of the enterprise or (b) liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise&#146;s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments. In January 2005, the SEC issued SAB No. 107, which provides supplemental implementation guidance for SFAS No. 123R. SFAS No. 123R eliminates the ability to account for stock-based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method under Accounting Principles Board (&#147;APB&#148;) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees , and instead generally requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair-value-based method. The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton (&#147;BSM&#148;) option-pricing model to determine the fair-value of stock-based awards under SFAS No. 123R, consistent with that used for pro forma disclosures under SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation . The Company has elected to use the modified prospective transition method as permitted by SFAS No. 123R and accordingly prior periods have not been restated to reflect the impact of SFAS No. 123R. The modified prospective transition method requires that stock-based compensation expense be recorded for all new and unvested stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and employee stock purchase plan shares that are ultimately expected to vest as the requisite service is rendered beginning on September 25, 2005, the first day of the Company&#146;s fiscal year 2006. Stock-based compensation expense for awards granted prior to September 25, 2005 is based on the grant-date fair-value as determined under the pro forma provisions of SFAS No. 123. The Company recognized incremental stock-based compensation expense of $117 million during 2006 as a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R. Diluted earnings per common share was reduced by $0.10 for the year ended September 30, 2006 due to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R. In accordance with SFAS No. 123R, beginning in 2006 the Company has presented excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock-based compensation awards as a financing activity in the consolidated statement of cash flows. 

No stock-based compensation costs have been capitalized as of September 30, 2006. The income tax benefit related to stock-based compensation expense was $39 million for the year ended September 30, 2006. As of September 30, 2006, $375.2 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options and restricted stock units is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.91 years. 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

Note 1&#151;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 

SFAS No. 123R prohibits recognition of a deferred tax asset for an excess tax benefit that has not been realized. The Company will recognize a benefit from stock-based compensation in equity if an incremental tax benefit is realized by following the ordering provisions of the tax law. In addition, the Company accounts for the indirect effects of stock-based compensation on the research tax credit, the foreign tax credit, and the domestic manufacturing deduction through the income statement. 

Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the Company measured compensation expense for its employee stock-based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by APB Opinion No. 25. The Company applied the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123 as amended by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation&#151;Transition and Disclosure, as if the fair-value-based method had been applied in measuring compensation expense. Under APB Opinion No. 25, when the exercise price of the Company&#146;s employee stock options was equal to the market price of the underlying stock on the date of the grant, no compensation expense was recognized. 

The following table illustrates the effect on net income after taxes and net income per common share as if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 to stock-based compensation during 2005 and 2004 (in millions, except per share amounts):

Earnings Per Common Share 

Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential shares of common stock had been issued. The dilutive effect of outstanding options, restricted stock, and restricted stock units is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. Under the 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

Note 1&#151;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 

treasury stock method, an increase in the fair market value of the Company&#146;s common stock can result in a greater dilutive effect from outstanding options, restricted stock, and restricted stock units. Additionally, the exercise of employee stock options and the vesting of restricted stock and restricted stock units can result in a greater dilutive effect on earnings per share. 

The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share:

Comprehensive Income 

Comprehensive income consists of two components: net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income refers to revenue, expenses, gains, and losses that under generally accepted accounting principles are recorded as an element of shareholders&#146; equity but are excluded from net income. The Company&#146;s other comprehensive income is comprised of foreign currency translation adjustments from those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities categorized as available-for-sale, and net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges. 

Segment Information 

The Company reports segment information based on the &#147;management&#148; approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company&#146;s reportable segments. Information about the Company&#146;s products, major customers, and geographic areas on a company-wide basis is also disclosed. 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

Note 2&#151;Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements 

The Company is restating its consolidated balance sheet as of September 24, 2005, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders&#146; equity, and cash flows for each of the fiscal years ended September 24, 2005 and September 25, 2004, and each of the quarters in fiscal year 2005. 

Previously filed annual reports on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q affected by the restatements have not been amended and should not be relied on. 

On June 29, 2006, the Company announced that an internal review had discovered irregularities related to the issuance of certain stock option grants made between 1997 and 2001, including a grant to its Chief Executive Officer (&#147;CEO&#148;) Steve Jobs. The Company also announced that a Special Committee of outside directors (&#147;Special Committee&#148;) had been formed and had hired independent counsel to conduct a full investigation of the Company&#146;s past stock option granting practices. 

As a result of the internal review and the independent investigation, management has concluded, and the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors agrees, that incorrect measurement dates were used for financial accounting purposes for certain stock option grants made in prior periods. Therefore, the Company has recorded additional non-cash stock-based compensation expense and related tax effects with regard to past stock option grants, and the Company is restating previously filed financial statements in this Form 10-K. These adjustments, after tax, amounted to $4 million, $7 million, and $10 million in fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The adjustment to 2006 was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006 due to its insignificance. 

The independent counsel and its forensic accountants (&#147;Investigative Team&#148;) reviewed the facts and circumstances surrounding stock option grants made on 259 dates. Based on a review of the totality of evidence and the applicable law, the Special Committee found no misconduct by current management. The Special Committee&#146;s investigation identified a number of grants for which grant dates were intentionally selected in order to obtain favorable exercise prices. The terms of these and certain other grants, as discussed below, were finalized after the originally assigned grant dates. The Special Committee concluded that the procedures for granting, accounting for, and reporting stock option grants did not include sufficient safeguards to prevent manipulation. Although the investigation found that CEO Steve Jobs was aware or recommended the selection of some favorable grant dates, he did not receive or financially benefit from these grants or appreciate the accounting implications. The Special Committee also found that the investigation had raised serious concerns regarding the actions of two former officers in connection with the accounting, recording and reporting of stock option grants. 

Based on the evidence and findings from the Company&#146;s internal review and the Special Committee&#146;s independent investigation, an analysis was performed of the measurement dates for the 42,077 stock option grants made on 259 dates between October 1996 and January 2003 (the &#147;relevant period&#148;). The Company believes that the analysis was properly limited to the relevant period. In addition to analyzing all grants made during the relevant period, the Company sampled certain grants between 1994 and 1997 and found none that required accounting adjustments. The first grants for which stock-based compensation expense is required are dated December 29, 1997. The Company also examined grants made after the relevant period and found none that required accounting adjustments. Moreover, in the years after 2002, Apple made significant changes in its stock option granting practices in response to evolving legal, regulatory and accounting requirements. 

Consistent with the accounting literature and recent guidance from the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#147;SEC&#148;), the grants during the relevant period were organized into categories based on grant 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

Note 2&#151;Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

type and process by which the grant was finalized. The Company analyzed the evidence related to each category of grants including, but not limited to, electronic and physical documents, document metadata, and witness interviews. Based on the relevant facts and circumstances, the Company applied the controlling accounting standards to determine, for every grant within each category, the proper measurement date. If the measurement date is not the originally assigned grant date, accounting adjustments were made as required, resulting in stock-based compensation expense and related tax effects. 

The 42,077 grants were classified as follows: (1) 17 grants to persons elected or appointed to the Board of Directors (&#147;director grants&#148;); (2) 3,892 grants to employees under the Monday/Tuesday Plan described below (&#147;Monday/Tuesday grants&#148;); (3) 27,096 grants made in broad-based awards to large numbers of employees, usually on an annual basis (&#147;focal grants&#148;); (4) 9,988 other grants ratified at meetings of the Board or Compensation Committee (&#147;meeting grants&#148;); (5) 1,082 other grants ratified by unanimous written consent (&#147;UWC&#148;) of the Board or Compensation Committee (&#147;other UWC grants&#148;); and (6) two grants to the CEO (&#147;CEO grants&#148;). All references to the number of option shares, option exercise prices, and share prices in this Note 2 have not been adjusted for any subsequent stock splits. 

With the exception of director grants, all stock option grants were subject to ratification by the Board or Compensation Committee at a meeting or by UWC. Following approval of the grants at a meeting or by UWC, the Company&#146;s legal staff would prepare a Secretary&#146;s Certificate certifying the ratification of the grants. Based on the facts and circumstances described below, the Company has concluded that the recipients and terms of certain grants were fixed for accounting purposes before ratification pursuant to parameters previously approved by the Board or Compensation Committee through the Monday/Tuesday Plan and the focal process. As further discussed below, within these parameters, management had the authority to determine the recipients and terms for each grant. Thus, the Company has concluded that the measurement dates for these grants occurred when management&#146;s process for allocating these grants was completed and the grants were ready for ratification, which was considered perfunctory. With regard to all other grants, the Company has concluded that the grants were finalized and the measurement dates occurred when the grants were ratified. For many grants, however, the dates of ratification cannot be established because the dates the UWCs were executed by the Board or Compensation Committee members or received by the Company are not available. For such grants, the Company has concluded that the date of the preparation of the Secretary&#146;s Certificate is the best alternative for determining the actual date of ratification. 

As discussed below, the Company&#146;s analysis determined that the originally assigned grant dates for 6,428 grants on 42 dates are not the proper measurement dates. Accordingly, after accounting for forfeitures, the Company has recognized stock-based compensation expense of $105 million on a pre-tax basis over the respective awards&#146; vesting terms. No adjustments were required for the remaining 35,649 grants. The adjustments were determined by category as follows: 

Director Grants&#151;Seventeen director grants were made during the relevant period. Two director grants were made pursuant to a 1997 plan that dated the grants on the enactment of the plan. The remaining fifteen grants were automatically made under the Director Stock Option Plan for non-employee directors, which was approved by shareholders in 1998, on the date of a director&#146;s election or appointment to the Board and on subsequent anniversaries, beginning on the fourth anniversary. Accordingly, the analysis determined that the originally assigned grant date for each director grant is the measurement date, and no accounting adjustments are required.

Monday/Tuesday Grants&#151;Beginning in December 1998, 3,892 new hire grants and grants for promotion and retention purposes (&#147;promotion/retention grants&#148;) were made during the relevant period under the &#147;Monday/Tuesday Plan.&#148; Under the Monday/Tuesday Plan, new hire grants made within pre-established guidelines approved by the Board or Compensation Committee were dated on the Monday that the recipient started work (or the following Monday, if the recipient started on another day). The Company&#146;s analysis showed this process to be reliable with very low error rates. Promotion/retention grants, also based on pre-established guidelines, were made generally on the first Tuesday of each month. The Company has concluded that the new hire and promotion/retention grants made pursuant to the Monday/Tuesday Plan within pre-established guidelines do not require adjustment, with the exception of six grants that were erroneously dated before the employees&#146; start dates. For 120 new hire and promotion/retention grants made outside the guidelines, however, the Company has concluded that the measurement dates are the dates of ratification by the Board or Compensation Committee rather than the dates used for grants within guidelines. Accordingly, based on the methodology described above, the Company has recognized stock-based compensation expense of $6 million from 126 grants. 

Focal Grants&#151;During the relevant period, 27,096 focal grants were made to employees typically on an annual basis as part of an extensive process that required several months to complete. Pursuant to limits, guidelines and practices previously approved by the Board or Compensation Committee, managers throughout the Company would make recommendations for grants to employees in their areas of responsibility. After senior management had determined that the grants were made in accordance with these established limits, guidelines and practices, management treated the grants as final when they were submitted to the Board or Compensation Committee for ratification. The Company has concluded that for 5,595 grants on five dates, the originally assigned grant dates are not the proper measurement dates. For these grants, management&#146;s process for finalizing the grants was completed after the originally assigned grant dates. As a result, the Company has recognized $29 million of stock-based compensation expense. For two of the five grant dates comprising 3,744 grants, the evidence shows that the grants were finalized and the measurement date occurred one day after the originally assigned grant dates. The grants on these two dates represent more than $16 million of the total $29 million of stock-based compensation expense resulting from focal grants. 

Other Meeting Grants&#151;During the relevant period, meetings of the Board or Compensation Committee were held to ratify 9,988 grants that are not Monday/Tuesday, focal or CEO grants. The grant dates and measurement dates for these grants are the meeting dates when the grants were ratified, with the exception of 46 grants. Forty-two of these 46 grants are dated concurrent with a meeting that considered and approved certain grants, but the evidence indicates that all of the grants may not have been finalized until a later date. One of the 46 grants was approved and dated at another meeting, but the recipient, who was becoming employed by the Company as part of a corporate acquisition, did not start until a later date. Two other grants were approved before the employees&#146; start dates. Another grant was mistakenly cancelled and subsequently reinstated, requiring an accounting adjustment. Thus, for these 46 grants the Company has concluded that the originally assigned grant dates are not the proper measurement dates. As a result, the Company has recognized $2 million of stock-based compensation expense. 

Other UWC Grants&#151;During the relevant period, 1,082 grants were approved by UWCs for a variety of purposes, including executive recruitment, retention, promotion and new hires outside the Monday/Tuesday process. These grants were not made pursuant to pre-established guidelines adopted by the Board or Compensation Committee. Therefore, the Company has concluded that these grants were 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

Note 2&#151;Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

not finalized for accounting purposes until ratification by the Board or Compensation Committee. Accordingly, for 660 grants, the Company has concluded that the originally assigned grant dates are not the proper measurement dates. As a result, the Company has recognized $48 million of stock-based compensation expense. 

CEO Grants&#151;During the relevant period, the Company made two grants to CEO Steve Jobs. The first grant, dated January 12, 2000, was for 10 million option shares. The second grant, dated October 19, 2001, was for 7.5 million option shares. Both grants were cancelled in March 2003 prior to being exercised, when Mr. Jobs received 5 million shares of restricted stock. 

With respect to the grant dated January 12, 2000, the Board on December 2, 1999, authorized a special &#147;CEO Compensation Committee&#148; to grant Mr. Jobs up to 15 million shares. The evidence indicates that the CEO Compensation Committee finalized the terms of the grant on January 12, 2000, although the Committee&#146;s action was memorialized in a UWC transmitted on January 18, 2000. Because the measurement date is the originally assigned grant date, the Company has not recognized any stock-based compensation expense from this grant. If the Company had determined that the measurement date was the date when the UWC was executed or received, then additional stock-based compensation would have been recognized. 

The grant dated October 19, 2001 was originally approved at a Board meeting on August 29, 2001, with an exercise price of $17.83. The terms of the grant, however, were not finalized until December 18, 2001. The grant was dated October 19, 2001, with an exercise price of $18.30. The approval for the grant was improperly recorded as occurring at a special Board meeting on October 19, 2001. Such a special Board meeting did not occur. There was no evidence, however, that any current member of management was aware of this irregularity. The Company has recognized $20 million in stock-based compensation expense for this grant, reflecting the difference between the exercise price of $18.30 and the share price on December 18, 2001 of $21.01. 

The incremental impact from recognizing stock-based compensation expense resulting from the investigation of past stock option grants is as follows (dollars in millions):

##TABLE_END 

&#160; 

The unrealized losses on the Company&#146;s investments during 2006 in U.S. Government securities and during 2005 in U.S. Government securities, U.S. corporate securities, and foreign securities were caused primarily by changes in interest rates. The Company typically invests in highly-rated securities with low probabilities of default. The Company&#146;s investment policy requires investments to be rated single-A or better. Therefore, the Company considers the declines to be temporary in nature. As of September 30, 2006, the Company does not consider the investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired. 

Market values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. When evaluating the investments for other-than-temporary impairment, the Company reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer, and the Company&#146;s ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time, which may be sufficient for anticipated recovery in market value.

The Company distributes its products through third-party distributors and resellers and directly to certain education, consumer, and commercial customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company does attempt to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers in Latin America, Europe, Asia, and Australia and by arranging with third-party financing companies to provide flooring arrangements and other loan and lease programs to the Company&#146;s direct customers. These credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements. However, considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral, third-party flooring arrangements, or credit insurance are outstanding with the Company&#146;s distribution and retail channel partners. No customer accounted for more than 10% of trade receivables as of September 30, 2006 or September 24, 2005.

Vendor Non-Trade Receivables 

The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of raw material components to these manufacturing vendors who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these raw material components directly from suppliers. These non-trade receivables, which are included in the consolidated balance sheets in other current assets, totaled $1.6 billion and $417 million as of September 30, 2006 and September 24, 2005, respectively. The Company does not reflect the sale of these components in net sales and does not recognize any profits on these sales until the products are sold through to the end customer at which time the profit is recognized as a reduction of cost of sales. 

Derivative Financial Instruments 

The Company uses derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange risk. Foreign currency forward and option contracts are used to offset the foreign exchange risk on certain existing assets and liabilities and to hedge the foreign exchange risk on expected future cash flows on certain forecasted revenue and cost of sales. From time to time, the Company enters into interest rate derivative agreements to modify the interest rate profile of certain investments and debt. The Company&#146;s accounting policies for these instruments are based on whether the instruments are designated as hedge or non-hedge instruments. The Company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.

##TABLE_END 

&#160; 

The notional principal amounts for derivative instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume outstanding as of year-end, and do not represent the amount of the Company&#146;s exposure to credit or market loss. The credit risk amounts shown in the table above represents the Company&#146;s gross exposure to potential accounting loss on these transactions if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency exchange rates at each respective date. The Company&#146;s exposure to credit loss and market risk will vary over time as a function of currency exchange rates. 

The estimates of fair value are based on applicable and commonly used pricing models and prevailing financial market information as of September 30, 2006 and September 24, 2005. Although the table above reflects the notional principal, fair value, and credit risk amounts of the Company&#146;s foreign exchange instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated with the exposures and transactions that the foreign exchange instruments are intended to hedge. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments. 

Foreign Exchange Risk Management 

The Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risk associated with existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows, and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. Generally, the Company&#146;s practice is to hedge a majority of its existing material foreign exchange transaction exposures. However, the Company may not hedge certain foreign exchange transaction exposures due to immateriality, prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures, or limited availability of appropriate hedging instruments. 

To help protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company&#146;s U.S. dollar functional subsidiaries hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue, and the Company&#146;s non-U.S. dollar functional subsidiaries selling in local currencies hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries&#146; functional currency. Other comprehensive income 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

Note 3&#151;Financial Instruments (Continued) 

associated with hedges of foreign currency revenue is recognized as a component of net sales in the same period as the related sales are recognized, and other comprehensive income related to inventory purchases is recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs are recognized. Typically, the Company hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases over a time horizon of up to 6 months. 

Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable that the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within a subsequent 2 month time period. Deferred gains and losses in other comprehensive income associated with such derivative instruments are immediately reclassified into earnings in other income and expense. Any subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are also reflected in current earnings unless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions. The Company recognized a net gain of approximately $421,000 in 2006 and net losses of $1.6 million and $2.8 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively, in other income and expense related to the loss of hedge designation on discontinued cash flow hedges due to changes in the Company&#146;s forecast of future net sales and cost of sales and due to prevailing market conditions. As of September 30, 2006, the Company had a net deferred gain associated with cash flow hedges of approximately $2.8 million, net of taxes, substantially all of which is expected to be reclassified to earnings by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2007. 

The net gain or loss on the effective portion of a derivative instrument designated as a net investment hedge is included in the cumulative translation adjustment account of accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders&#146; equity. For the years ended September 30, 2006 and September 24, 2005, the Company had net gains of $7.4 million and $673,000, respectively, included in the cumulative translation adjustment. 

The Company may also enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the foreign exchange gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of certain assets and liabilities recorded in non-functional currencies. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized in current earnings in other income and expense as offsets to the changes in the fair value of the related assets or liabilities. Due to currency market movements, changes in option time value can lead to increased volatility in other income and expense.

As of September 30, 2006, and September 24, 2005, the weighted-average amortization period for acquired technology was 8.5 years and 5.5 years, respectively. 

During 2006, the Company sold certain assets related to its PowerSchool web-based student information system operations. In connection with this sale, the Company reduced goodwill by $31 million for the outstanding balance from the acquisition of PowerSchool, Inc. in 2001 and recognized a $4 million pre-tax gain, which is reflected in other income and expense in the consolidated statement of operations. 

During 2005, the Company recorded an adjustment of approximately $11 million to goodwill relating to a reduction of valuation allowances that were recorded at the time certain net operating loss carryforwards (&#147;NOLs&#148;) were acquired in previous business combinations. During 2005, these NOLs were deemed to be more likely than not to be realized and accordingly the valuation allowances were reversed against the related goodwill that was recognized at the time of the acquisitions.

Note 6&#151;Restructuring Charges 

During 2004, the Company recorded total restructuring charges of approximately $23.0 million, including approximately $14.0 million in severance costs, $5.5 million in asset impairments, and $3.5 million for lease cancellations. The lease cancellations relate to vacating a leased sales facility from a European workforce reduction during 2004. Of the $23.0 million charges, $21.3 million had been utilized by the end of 2006, with the remainder consisting of $1.7 million for lease cancellations. These actions have resulted in the termination of 452 positions.

The foreign provision for income taxes is based on foreign pretax earnings of approximately $1.5 billion, $922 million, and $384 million in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. As of September 30, 2006, 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

Note 7&#151;Income Taxes (Continued) 

approximately $4.1 billion of the Company&#146;s cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments were held by foreign subsidiaries and are generally based in U.S. dollar-denominated holdings. Amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to U.S. income taxation on repatriation to the U.S. The Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements provide for any related tax liability on amounts that may be repatriated, aside from undistributed earnings of certain of the Company&#146;s foreign subsidiaries that are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the U.S. U.S. income taxes have not been provided on a cumulative total of $823 million of such earnings. It is not practicable to determine the income tax liability that might be incurred if these earnings were to be distributed. 

On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (&#147;AJCA&#148;) was signed into law. The AJCA included a provision for the deduction of 85% of certain foreign earnings that were repatriated, as defined in the AJCA, within a specified time frame. Among other requirements, dividends qualifying for the 85% deduction must be reinvested in the United States in certain qualified investments pursuant to a domestic reinvestment plan approved by the Chief Executive Officer (&#147;CEO&#148;) and Board of Directors. During 2006, the Company repatriated approximately $1.6 billion of foreign earnings. Of the earnings repatriated, $755 million is eligible for the reduced tax rate provided by the AJCA. Accordingly, the Company recorded a tax charge of $51 million related to the repatriation of foreign earnings under the provisions of the AJCA. In addition, the Company recorded a tax benefit of $71 million resulting from the implementation of tax planning strategies to recognize deferred tax assets that were previously not recognizable within certain foreign subsidiaries. 

Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the effects of tax losses, credits, and the future income tax effects of temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. 

As of September 30, 2006 and September 24, 2005, the significant components of the Company&#146;s deferred tax assets and liabilities were (in millions):

As of September 30, 2006, the Company has state and foreign tax loss and state credit carryforwards, the tax effect of which is $55 million. Certain of those carryforwards, the tax effect of which is $12 million, expire between 2016 a nd 2019. A portion of these carryforwards was acquired from the Company&#146;s previous acquisitions, the utilization of which is subject to certain limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. The remaining benefits from tax losses and credits do not expire. As of September 30, 2006 and September 24, 2005, a valuation allowance of $5 million was recorded against the deferred tax asset for the benefits of state operating losses that may not be realized. Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets.

The Company&#146;s income taxes payable has been reduced by the tax benefits from employee stock options. The Company receives an income tax benefit calculated as the difference between the fair market value of the stock issued at the time of the exercise and the option price, tax effected. The net tax benefits from employee stock option transactions were $419 million, $428 million (as restated(1)), and $83 million (as restated(1)) in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively, and were reflected as an increase to common stock in the consolidated statements of shareholders&#146; equity. 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

Note 7&#151;Income Taxes (Continued) 

The Internal Revenue Service (&#147;IRS&#148;) has substantially completed its field audit of the Company&#146;s federal income tax returns for the years 2002 through 2003 and proposed certain adjustments. The Company intends to contest certain of these adjustments through the IRS Appeals Office. Substantially all IRS audit issues for years prior to 2002 have been resolved. In addition, the Company is also subject to audits by state, local, and foreign tax authorities. Management believes that adequate provisions have been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. Should any issues addressed in the Company&#146;s tax audits be resolved in a manner not consistent with management&#146;s expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income tax in the period such resolution occurs. In 2006, the Company recorded a tax benefit of $20 million due to the settlement of prior year tax audits in the U.S. 

Note 8&#151;Shareholders&#146; Equity 

Preferred Stock 

The Company has five million shares of authorized preferred stock, none of which is outstanding. Under the terms of the Company&#146;s Restated Articles of Incorporation, the Board of Directors is authorized to determine or alter the rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions of the Company&#146;s authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock. 

Restricted Stock Units 

The Company&#146;s Board of Directors has granted restricted stock units to members of the Company&#146;s senior management team, excluding its CEO. These restricted stock units generally vest over four years either at the end of the four-year service period, in two equal installments on the second and fourth anniversaries of the date of grant, or in equal installments on each of the first through fourth anniversaries of the grant date. Upon vesting, the restricted stock units will convert into an equivalent number of shares of common stock. The amounts of the restricted stock units expensed by the Company are based on the closing market price of the Company&#146;s common stock on the date of grant and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the four-year requisite service period. The restricted stock units have been reflected in the calculation of diluted earnings per share utilizing the treasury stock method. 

2.47 million previously granted restricted stock units vested during 2006. A majority of these vested restricted stock units were net-share settled such that the Company withheld shares with value equivalent to the employees&#146; minimum statutory obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes, and remitted the cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. The total shares withheld of 985,833 for 2006 was based on the value of the restricted stock units on their vesting date as determined by the Company&#146;s closing stock price. Total payments for the employees&#146; tax obligations to the taxing authorities were approximately $59 million. These net-share settlements had the effect of share repurchases by the Company as they reduced and retired the number of shares that would have otherwise been issued as a result of the vesting and did not represent an expense to the Company. 

CEO Restricted Stock Award 

On March 19, 2003, the Company&#146;s Board of Directors granted 10 million shares of restricted stock to the Company&#146;s CEO that vested on March 19, 2006. The amount of the restricted stock award expensed by the Company was based on the closing market price of the Company&#146;s common stock on the date of grant and was amortized on a straight-line basis over the three-year requisite service period. 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

Note 8&#151;Shareholders&#146; Equity (Continued) 

Upon vesting during 2006, the restricted stock award was net-share settled such that the Company withheld shares with value equivalent to the CEO&#146;s minimum statutory obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes, and remitted the cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. The total shares withheld of 4.6 million was based on the value of the restricted stock award on the vesting date as determined by the Company&#146;s closing stock price of $64.66. The remaining shares net of those withheld were delivered to the Company&#146;s CEO. Total payments for the CEO&#146;s tax obligations to the taxing authorities were approximately $296 million. The net-share settlement had the effect of share repurchases by the Company as it reduced and retired the number of shares outstanding and did not represent an expense to the Company. 

Stock Repurchase Plan 

In July 1999, the Company&#146;s Board of Directors authorized a plan for the Company to repurchase up to $500 million of its common stock. This repurchase plan does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares or acquire shares over any specified period of time. The Company has repurchased a total of 13.1 million shares at a cost of $217 million under this plan and was authorized to repurchase up to an additional $283 million of its common stock as of September 30, 2006. 

Comprehensive Income 

Comprehensive income consists of two components: net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income refers to revenue, expenses, gains, and losses that under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles are recorded as an element of shareholders&#146; equity but are excluded from net income. The Company&#146;s other comprehensive income consists of foreign currency translation adjustments from those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities categorized as available-for-sale, and net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges.

Employee Benefit Plans 

2003 Employee Stock Plan 

The 2003 Employee Stock Plan (the &#147;2003 Plan&#148;) is a shareholder approved plan that provides for broad-based grants to employees, including executive officers. Based on the terms of individual option grants, options granted under the 2003 Plan generally expire 7 to 10 years after the grant date and generally become exercisable over a period of 4 years, based on continued employment, with either annual or quarterly vesting. The 2003 Plan permits the granting of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, and stock purchase rights. 

1997 Employee Stock Option Plan 

In August 1997, the Company&#146;s Board of Directors approved the 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan (the &#147;1997 Plan&#148;), a non-shareholder approved plan for grants of stock options to employees who are not officers of the Company. Based on the terms of individual option grants, options granted under the 1997 Plan generally expire 7 to 10 years after the grant date and generally become exercisable over a period of 4 years, based on continued employment, with either annual or quarterly vesting. In October 2003, the Company terminated the 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan and cancelled all remaining unissued shares totaling 28,590,702. No new options can be granted from the 1997 Plan. 

Employee Stock Option Exchange Program 

On March 20, 2003, the Company announced a voluntary employee stock option exchange program (the &#147;Exchange Program&#148;) whereby eligible employees, other than executive officers and members of the Board of Directors, had an opportunity to exchange outstanding options with exercise prices at or above $12.50 per share for a predetermined smaller number of new stock options issued with exercise prices equal to the fair market value of one share of the Company&#146;s common stock on the day the new awards were issued, which was to be at least six months plus one day after the exchange options were cancelled. On April 17, 2003, in accordance with the Exchange Program, the Company cancelled options to purchase 33,138,386 shares of its common stock. On October 22, 2003, new stock options totaling 13,394,736 shares were issued to employees at an exercise price of $11.38 per share, which is equivalent to the closing price of the Company&#146;s stock on that date. No financial or accounting impact to the Company&#146;s financial position, results of operations or cash flows was associated with this transaction.

1997 Director Stock Option Plan 

In August 1997, the Company&#146;s Board of Directors adopted a Director Stock Option Plan (&#147;Director Plan&#148;) for non-employee directors of the Company, which was approved by shareholders in 1998. Pursuant to the Director Plan, the Company&#146;s non-employee directors are granted an option to acquire 30,000 shares of Common Stock upon their initial election to the Board (&#147;Initial Options &#148; ). The Initial Options vest and become exercisable in three equal annual installments on each of the first through third anniversaries of the grant date. On the fourth anniversary of a non-employee director&#146;s initial election to the Board and on each subsequent anniversary thereafter, the director will be entitled to receive an option to acquire 10,000 shares of Common Stock (&#147;Annual Options&#148;). Annual Options are fully vested and immediately exercisable on their date of grant. 

Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans 

Certain of the Company&#146;s executive officers, including Mr. Timothy D. Cook, Mr. Peter Oppenheimer, Mr. Philip W. Schiller, and Dr. Bertrand Serlet, have entered into trading plans pursuant to Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. A trading plan is a written document that pre-establishes the amounts, prices and dates (or formula for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of the Company&#146;s stock including the exercise and sale of employee stock options and shares acquired pursuant to the Company&#146;s employee stock purchase plan and upon vesting of restricted stock units. 

Employee Stock Purchase Plan 

The Company has a shareholder approved employee stock purchase plan (the &#147;Purchase Plan&#148;), under which substantially all employees may purchase common stock through payroll deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market values as of the beginning and end of six month offering periods. Stock purchases under the Purchase Plan are limited to 10% of an employee&#146;s compensation, up to a maximum of $25,000 in any calendar year. The number of shares authorized for issuance is limited to a total of 1 million shares per offering period. During 2006, 2005, and 2004, adjusted for the February 2005 stock split, 1.5 million, 2.3 million, and 3.9 million shares, respectively, were issued under the Purchase Plan. As of September 30, 2006, approximately 2.3 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the Purchase Plan. 

Employee Savings Plan 

The Company has an employee savings plan (the &#147;Savings Plan&#148;) qualifying as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the Savings Plan, participating U.S. employees may defer a portion of their pre-tax earnings, up to the Internal Revenue Service annual contribution limit ($15,000 for calendar year 2006). The Company matches 50% to 100% of each employee&#146;s contributions, depending on length of service, up to a maximum 6% of the employee&#146;s earnings. The Company&#146;s matching contributions to the Savings Plan were approximately $33 million, $28 million, and $24 million in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.

In conjunction with the amendments to the 2003 Plan that were approved at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on April 21, 2005, the number of shares available for grant under the 2003 Plan will be reduced by two times the number of restricted shares and restricted stock units granted. This amendment is effective for all grants made after April 21, 2005. 

Aggregate intrinsic value represents the value of the Company&#146;s closing stock price on the last trading day of the fiscal period in excess of the exercise price multiplied by the number of options outstanding or exercisable. Total intrinsic value of options at time of exercise was $1.2 billion, $1.1 billion, and $266.9 million for 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. 

As of September 30, 2006, the Company had 3.41 million restricted stock units outstanding with a total grant-date fair value of $135.1 million that were excluded from the options outstanding balances in the preceding table. The weighted-average grant date fair value of restricted stock units granted during 2006, 2005, and 2004 was $70.92, $45.04, and $12.81, respectively. Aggregate intrinsic value of unvested restricted stock units at September 30, 2006 was $262.5 million. Restricted stock units that vested during 2006 totaled 2.47 million and had a fair value of $148.5 million as of the vesting date. Granted restricted stock units have been deducted from the shares available for grant under the Company&#146;s stock option plans.

Note 8&#151;Shareholders' Equity (Continued) 

The number of shares of restricted stock that vested during 2006 was 10 million, which had a fair value of $646.6 million. The grant-date fair value of restricted stock that fully vested during 2006 was $7.48 per share. For the years ended September 30, 2006, September 24, 2005, and September 25, 2004, compensation expense related to restricted stock was $4.6 million, $24.9 million, and $24.9 million, respectively. 

Note 9&#151;Stock-Based Compensation 

The Company has provided pro forma disclosures in Note 1 of these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the effect on net income and earnings per share for the years ended September 24, 2005 and September 25, 2004 as if the fair value method of accounting for stock compensation had been used for its employee stock option grants and employee stock purchase plan purchases. These pro forma effects have been estimated at the date of grant and beginning of the period, respectively, using the BSM option pricing model. 

The weighted average assumptions used for 2006, 2005, and 2004 and the resulting estimates of weighted-average fair value per share of options granted and for stock purchases during those periods are as follows:

Pursuant to SFAS No. 123R, the expected volatility assumptions used by the Company are based on the historical volatility of the Company&#146;s common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of the Company&#146;s stock options and other relevant factors including implied volatility in market traded options on the Company&#146;s common stock. The Company bases its expected life assumption on its historical experience and on the terms and conditions of the stock options it grants to employees.

Lease Commitments 

The Company leases various equipment and facilities, including retail space, under noncancelable operating lease arrangements. The Company does not currently utilize any other off-balance-sheet financing arrangements. The major facility leases are for terms of 5 to 15 years and generally provide 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

Note 10&#151;Commitments and Contingencies (Continued) 

renewal options for terms of 3 to 5 additional years. Leases for retail space are for terms of 5 to 20 years, the majority of which are for 10 years, and often contain multi-year renewal options. As of September 30, 2006, the Company&#146;s total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were approximately $1.2 billion, of which $887 million related to leases for retail space. 

Rent expense under all operating leases, including both cancelable and noncancelable leases, was $138 million, $140 million, and $103 million in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases having remaining terms in excess of one year as of September 30, 2006, are as follows (in millions):

Accrued Warranty and Indemnifications 

The Company offers a basic limited parts and labor warranty on its hardware products. The basic warranty period for hardware products is typically one year from the date of purchase by the end-user. The Company also offers a 90-day basic warranty for its service parts used to repair the Company&#146;s hardware products. The Company provides currently for the estimated cost that may be incurred under its basic limited product warranties at the time related revenue is recognized. Factors considered in determining appropriate accruals for product warranty obligations include the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection, historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the Company&#146;s typical experience. The Company assesses the adequacy of its preexisting warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual experience and changes in future estimates. 

The Company periodically provides updates to its applications and system software to maintain the software&#146;s compliance with specifications. The estimated cost to develop such updates is accounted for as warranty costs that are recognized at the time related software revenue is recognized. Factors considered in determining appropriate accruals related to such updates include the number of units delivered, the number of updates expected to occur, and the historical cost and estimated future cost of the resources necessary to develop these updates. 

The following table reconciles changes in the Company&#146;s accrued warranties and related costs (in millions):

Note 10&#151;Commitments and Contingencies (Continued) 

The Company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual property rights. Other agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the Company or an indemnified third-party. However, the Company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against itself or an indemnified third-party and, in the opinion of management, does not have a potential liability related to unresolved infringement claims subject to indemnification that would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. Therefore, the Company did not record a liability for infringement costs as of either September 30, 2006 or September 24, 2005. 

Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product 

Although most components essential to the Company&#146;s business are generally available from multiple sources, other key components (including microprocessors and application-specific integrated circuits (&#147;ASICs&#148;)) are currently obtained by the Company from single or limited sources. Some other key components, while currently available to the Company from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide availability and pricing pressures. In addition, the Company uses some components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer industry, and new products introduced by the Company often initially utilize custom components obtained from only one source until the Company has evaluated whether there is a need for and subsequently qualifies additional suppliers. If the supply of a key single-sourced component to the Company were to be delayed or curtailed, or in the event a key manufacturing vendor delays shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company&#146;s ability to ship related products in desired quantities and in a timely manner could be adversely affected. The Company&#146;s business and financial performance could also be adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability of these components may be affected if producers were to decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company&#146;s requirements. Finally, significant portions of the Company&#146;s CPUs, logic boards, and assembled products are now manufactured by outsourcing partners, primarily in various parts of Asia. Although the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the Company&#146;s operating results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production obligations. 

Long-Term Supply Agreements 

During 2006, the Company entered into long-term supply agreements with Hynix Semiconductor, Inc., Intel Corporation, Micron Technology, Inc., Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., and Toshiba Corporation to secure supply of NAND flash memory through calendar year 2010. As part of these agreements, the Company prepaid $1.25 billion for flash memory components during 2006. These prepayments will be applied to inventory purchases made over the life of each respective agreement. 

Contingencies 

The Company is subject to certain other legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not been fully adjudicated. In the opinion of management, the Company does not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and claims that would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, liquidity, or results of operations. 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

Note 10&#151;Commitments and Contingencies (Continued) 

However, the results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Should the Company fail to prevail in any of these legal matters or should several of these legal matters be resolved against the Company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected. 

Production and marketing of products in certain states and countries may subject the Company to environmental and other regulations including, in some instances, the requirement to provide customers the ability to return product at the end of its useful life, and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the Company. Such laws and regulations have recently been passed in several jurisdictions in which the Company operates including various European Union member countries, Japan and certain states within the U.S. Although the Company does not anticipate any material adverse effects in the future based on the nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws, there is no assurance that such existing laws or future laws will not have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s financial condition, liquidity, or results of operations. 

Note 11&#151;Segment Information and Geographic Data 

In accordance with SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information , the Company reports segment information based on the &#147;management&#148; approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company&#146;s reportable segments. 

The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company&#146;s reportable operating segments are comprised of the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Retail. The Americas, Europe, and Japan reportable segments do not include activities related to the Retail segment. The Americas segment includes both North and South America. The Europe segment includes European countries as well as the Middle East and Africa. The Retail segment operates Apple-owned retail stores in the U.S., Canada, Japan, and the U.K. Other operating segments include Asia-Pacific, which includes Australia and Asia except for Japan, and the Company&#146;s subsidiary, FileMaker, Inc. Each reportable geographic operating segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar services, and the accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described in Note 1, &#147;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,&#148; except as described below for the Retail segment. 

The Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on net sales. The Retail segment&#146;s performance is also evaluated based on operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally based on the location of the customers. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales, and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses that are managed outside the operating segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as manufacturing costs and variances not included in standard costs, research and development, corporate marketing expenses, stock-based compensation expense, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges, and other separately managed general and administrative expenses including certain corporate expenses associated with support of the Retail segment. The Company does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes. Segment assets exclude corporate assets. Corporate assets include cash, short-term and long-term investments, manufacturing facilities, miscellaneous corporate infrastructure, goodwill and other acquired intangible assets, and retail store construction-in-progress that is not subject to depreciation. Except for the Retail segment, capital 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

Note 11&#151;Segment Information and Geographic Data (Continued) 

expenditures for long-lived assets are not reported to management by segment. Capital expenditures by the Retail segment were $200 million, $132 million, and $104 million for 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.Operating income for all segments, except Retail, includes cost of sales at manufacturing standard cost, other cost of sales, related sales and marketing costs, and certain general and administrative costs. This measure of operating income, which includes manufacturing profit, provides a comparable basis for comparison between the Company&#146;s various geographic segments. Certain manufacturing expenses and related adjustments not included in segment cost of sales, including variances between standard and actual manufacturing costs and the mark-up above standard cost for product supplied to the Retail segment, are included in corporate expenses. 

Management assesses the operating performance of the Retail segment differently than it assesses the operating performance of the Company&#146;s geographic segments. The Retail segment revenue and operating income is intended to depict a measure comparable to that of the Company&#146;s major channel partners in the U.S. operating retail stores so the Company can evaluate the Retail segment performance as if it were a channel partner. Therefore, the Company makes three significant adjustments to the Retail segment for management reporting purposes that are not included in the results of the Company&#146;s other segments. 

First, the Retail segment&#146;s operating income includes cost of sales for Apple products at an amount normally charged to major channel partners in the U.S. operating retail stores, less the cost of sales programs and incentives provided to those channel partners and the Company&#146;s cost to support those partners. For the years ended September 30, 2006, September 24, 2005, and September 25, 2004, this resulted in the recognition of additional cost of sales above standard cost by the Retail segment and an offsetting benefit to corporate expenses of approximately $663 million, $435 million, and $213 million, respectively. 

Second, the Company&#146;s service and support contracts are transferred to the Retail segment at the same cost as that charged to the Company&#146;s major retail channel partners in the U.S., resulting in a measure of revenue and gross margin for those items that is comparable between the Company&#146;s retail stores and those retail channel partners. The Retail segment recognizes the full amount of revenue and cost of sales of the Company&#146;s service and support contracts at the time of sale. Because the Company has not yet earned the revenue or incurred the costs associated with the sale of these contracts, an offset to these amounts is recognized in other operating segments&#146; net sales and cost of sales. For the year ended September 30, 2006, this resulted in the recognition of net sales and cost of sales by the Retail segment, with corresponding offsets in other operating segments, of $159 million and $109 million, respectively. For the year ended September 24, 2005, this resulted in the recognition of net sales and cost of sales by the Retail segment of $92 million and $64 million, respectively. For the year ended September 25, 2004, this resulted in the recognition of net sales and cost of sales by the Retail segment of $54 million and $37 million, respectively. 

Third, the Company had opened a total of eight high-profile stores as of September 30, 2006. These high-profile stores are larger than the Company&#146;s typical retail stores and were designed to further promote brand awareness and provide a venue for certain corporate sales and marketing activities, including corporate briefings. As such, the Company allocates certain operating expenses associated with these stores to corporate marketing expense to reflect the estimated benefit realized Company-wide. The allocation of these operating costs is based on the amount incurred for a high-profile store in excess of that incurred by a more typical Company retail location. Expenses allocated to corporate marketing resulting 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

Note 11&#151;Segment Information and Geographic Data (Continued) 

from the operations of these stores were $33 million, $31 million, and $16 million for the years ended September 30, 2006, September 24, 2005, and September 25, 2004, respectively.Summary information by operating segment follows (in millions):

Note 12&#151;Related Party Transactions and Certain Other Transactions 

In March 2002, the Company entered into a Reimbursement Agreement with its CEO, Steve Jobs, for the reimbursement of expenses incurred by Mr. Jobs in the operation of his private plane when used for Company business. The Reimbursement Agreement became effective for expenses incurred by Mr. Jobs for Company business purposes since he took delivery of the plane in May 2001. The Company recognized a total of $202,000, $1,100,000, and $483,000 in expenses pursuant to the Reimbursement Agreement during 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. All expenses recognized pursuant to the Reimbursement Agreement have been included in selling, general, and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. 

In 2006, the Company entered into an agreement with Pixar to sell certain of Pixar&#146;s short films on the iTunes Store. Mr. Jobs was the CEO, Chairman, and a large shareholder of Pixar. On May 5, 2006, The Walt Disney Company (&#147;Disney&#148;) acquired Pixar, which resulted in Pixar becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Disney. Upon Disney&#146;s acquisition of Pixar, Mr. Jobs&#146; shares of Pixar common stock were exchanged for Disney&#146;s common stock and he was elected to the Disney Board of Directors. Royalty expense recognized by the Company under the arrangement with Pixar from September 25, 2005 through May 5, 2006 was less than $1 million.

The impact of the stock-based compensation adjustments was not significant to any of the interim balance sheets for fiscal year 2005. 

Basic and diluted earnings per share are computed independently for each of the quarters presented. Therefore, the sum of quarterly basic and diluted per share information may not equal annual basic and diluted earnings per share. 

Net income during the fourth quarter of 2005 benefited by $81 million from the reversal of certain tax contingency reserves and adjustments to net deferred tax assets, including reductions to valuation allowances.

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#146;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2006 and September 24, 2005, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2006, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

As discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the consolidated financial statements as of September 24, 2005 and for each of the years in the two-year period ended September 24, 2005 have been restated. 

As discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, effective September 25, 2005, the Company adopted the provision of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment . 

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated December 29, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on management&#146;s assessment of, and the effective operation of internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

The Board of Directors and Shareholders Apple Computer, Inc.: 

We have audited management&#146;s assessment, included in the accompanying Management&#146;s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, that Apple Computer, Inc. and subsidiaries maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Apple Computer, Inc.&#146;s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management&#146;s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Apple Computer, Inc.&#146;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management&#146;s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#146;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

In our opinion, management&#146;s assessment that Apple Computer, Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by COSO. Also, in our opinion, Apple Computer, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by COSO. 

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Apple Computer, Inc. as of September 30, 2006 and September 24, 2005, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders&#146; equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2006, and our report dated December 29, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.
