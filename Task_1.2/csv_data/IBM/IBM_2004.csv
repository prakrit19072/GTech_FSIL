1," Item 1. Business: 

International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) was incorporated in the State of New York on June 16, 1911, as the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Co. (C-T-R), a consolidation of the Computing Scale Co. of America, the Tabulating Machine Co., and The International Time Recording Co. of New York. Since that time, IBM has focused on the intersection of business insight and technological invention, and its operations and aims have been international in nature. This was signaled 80 years ago, in 1924, when C-T-R changed its name to International Business Machines Corporation. And it continues today: IBM is the largest information technology company in the world, the world's largest business and technology services company, the world's largest consulting services organization, the world's largest information technology research organization, and the world's largest financier of information technology. 

* * * 

IBM is an innovation-based business serving the needs of enterprises and institutions worldwide. It defines innovation as the intersection of business insight and technological invention. IBM seeks to deliver client success&#151;in whatever ways its clients define success&#151;by giving them differentiating capabilities that provide unique competitive advantage. 

By helping its clients redesign their business processes and organizational structure, enabled by new operating environments, IBM helps them to become on demand businesses. IBM defines an on demand business as an enterprise whose business processes are responsive to any demand, opportunity or threat; integrated end-to-end across the company; and capable of integrating fluidly across extended business ecosystems of partners, suppliers and clients. 

IBM first described this new model and set of capabilities in 2002, believing they represent the current evolution of information technology architectures and of business and institutional models. IBM calls this architecture the On Demand Operating Environment: an infrastructure based on industry-wide standards (commonly referred to as ""open standards""), rather than proprietary technologies. In IBM's view, an enterprise's investment in such an infrastructure provides both superior returns and maximum freedom of interoperability and action. Standards have become a core element of IBM's overall strategy and impact all of our unit strategies. 

The shift to standards-based technologies has been bolstered significantly in recent years by the rapid growth of the ""open source"" software movement, a result of large-scale collaboration among members of the worldwide developer and business communities. Examples include the Linux operating system, the Eclipse computing platform and the Java programming language. 

IBM's clients include many different kinds of enterprises, from sole proprietorships to the world's largest organizations, governments and companies representing every major industry and endeavor. Over the last decade, IBM has exited or greatly de-emphasized its involvement in consumer markets and divested itself of other noncore businesses to concentrate on the enterprise market. In IBM's view, opportunities in the enterprise market are superior&#151;representing approximately two-thirds of the IT industry's revenue. As a result, IBM has made acquisitions and invested in emerging business opportunities important to its enterprise clients. Many of these investments have grown into multibillion dollar businesses in their own right, and are now contributing to IBM's growth. 

The majority of the company's enterprise business, which excludes the company's original equipment manufacturer (OEM) technology business, occurs in industries that are broadly grouped into six sectors around which the company's go-to-market strategies, and sales and distribution activities are organized: 

&#149; Financial Services: Banking, Financial Markets, Insurance 1 

&#149; Public: Education, Government, Healthcare, Life Sciences &#149; Industrial: Aerospace, Automotive, Defense, Chemical and Petroleum, Electronics &#149; Distribution: Consumer Products, Retail, Travel, Transportation &#149; Communications: Telecommunications, Media and Entertainment, Energy and Utilities &#149; Small and Medium Business: mainly companies with less than 1,000 employees The IT Industry and IBM's Strategy 

IBM operates in the IT industry, which comprises three principal categories: 

&#149; Business Value &#149; Infrastructure Value &#149; Component Value IBM has realized and continues to see a shift in revenue and profit growth from Component Value to Infrastructure Value and Business Value, where revenue and profit potential are thought to be greatest in the years ahead. 

Business Value 

The company helps its clients transform their businesses and gain competitive advantage by applying its skills and experience to business performance challenges specific to the client's industry or across industries and processes. The company enters into long-term relationships and creates solutions for clients, driving on demand business innovation, on its own or in partnership with other companies.

Business Segments 

Organizationally, the company's major operations comprise a Global Services segment; a Systems and Technology Group; a Personal Systems Group; a Software segment; a Global Financing segment; and an Enterprise Investments segment. 

&#160; Global Services is a critical component of the company's strategy of providing insight and solutions to clients. While solutions often include industry-leading IBM software and hardware, other suppliers' products are also used if a client solution requires it. Global Services outsourcing contracts as well as BCS contracts range from less than one year to ten years. 

&#160; Systems and Technology Group provides IBM's clients with business solutions requiring advanced computing power and storage capabilities. More than half of the Systems and Technology Group's eServer and Storage Systems sales transactions are through business partners and approximately 40 percent are direct to end-user clients and more than half are through the Web at ibm.com. In addition, the group provides leading semiconductor technology and products, packaging solutions and engineering technology services to OEM clients (approximately 14 percent of Systems and Technology Group revenue) and for IBM's own advanced technology needs. While appropriately not reported as external revenue, hardware is also deployed to support Global Services solutions. 

&#160; Personal Systems Group includes sales of personal computers, business and computing solutions for retail stores and advanced printing capabilities for large enterprise clients and small and medium-sized businesses. In December 2004, it was announced that Lenovo Group Limited, the largest information technology company in China, will acquire IBM's Personal Computing Division. This transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2005. 

&#160; Software consists primarily of middleware and operating systems software. Middleware software enables clients to integrate systems, processes and applications across their enterprises. Middleware is designed to be the underlying support for applications provided by independent software vendors (ISVs), who build industry- or process-specific applications according to open industry standards. Operating systems are the engines that run computers. Approximately 40 percent of external Software revenue relates to one-time charge (OTC) arrangements, whereby the client pays one up-front payment for a lifetime license. The remaining annuity revenue consists of both maintenance revenue sold with OTC arrangements, as well as software sold on a monthly license charge (MLC) arrangement. Typically, arrangements for the sale of OTC software include one year of maintenance. The client can also purchase ongoing maintenance after the first year, which includes product upgrades and technical support. 

&#160; Global Financing is described on pages 35 to 39 of IBM's 2004 Annual Report to Stockholders which is hereby incorporated by reference. 

&#160; Enterprise Investments develops and provides industry-specific IT solutions supporting the Hardware, Software and Global Services segments of the company. Primary product lines include product life cycle management software and document processing technologies. Product life cycle management software primarily serves the Industrial sector and helps clients manage the development and manufacturing of their products. Document processor products service the Financial Services sector and include products that enable electronic banking. 

IBM WORLDWIDE ORGANIZATIONS 

The following three company-wide organizations play key roles in IBM's delivery of value to its clients: 

&#149; Sales &#38; Distribution Organization and related sales channels &#149; Research, Development and Intellectual Property &#149; Integrated Supply Chain 5 

Sales &#38; Distribution Organization 

With comprehensive knowledge of IBM's business and infrastructure solutions, as well as the individual products, technologies and services offered by IBM and its network of business partners, the company's global team of account representatives and solutions professionals gain a deep understanding of each client's organizational, infrastructure and industry-specific needs to determine the best approach for addressing the client's critical business and IT challenges. These professionals work in integrated teams with IBM consultants and technology representatives, combining their deep skills and expertise to deliver high-value solutions. 

Internal Routes-to-Market 

Global Services consultants focused on selling end-to-end solutions for large, complex business challenges. 

Hardware and software brand specialists selling IBM products as parts of discrete technology decisions, typically to ""self-integrating"" IT departments. 

ibm.com Online and telephone sales and assistance operations handle basic commodity transactions for large enterprises and small-to-medium businesses. 

Business Partners Routes-to-Market 

Global/major independent software vendors (ISVs). ISVs deliver business process or industry-specific applications and, in doing so, often influence the sale of IBM hardware, middleware and services. 

Global/major systems integrators (SIs). SIs identify business problems and design solutions when Global Services is not the preferred systems integrator; they also sell computing infrastructures from IBM and its competitors. 

Regional ISVs and SIs. SIs identify the business problems, and ISVs deliver business process or industry-specific applications to medium-sized and large businesses requiring IBM computing infrastructure offerings. 

Solutions providers, resellers and distributors. Resellers sell IBM platforms and value-added services as part of a discrete technology platform decision to clients wanting third-party assistance. 

Research, Development and Intellectual Property 

IBM's research and development (R&#38;D) operations differentiate IBM from its competitors. IBM annually spends approximately $5-6 billion for R&#38;D, including capitalized software costs, focusing its investments in high-growth opportunities. As a result of innovations in these and other areas, IBM was once again awarded more U.S. patents in 2004 than any other company. This marks the 12th year in a row that IBM achieved this distinction. 

In addition to producing world-class hardware and software products, IBM innovations are a major differentiator in providing solutions for the company's clients through its growing services activities. The company's investments in R&#38;D also result in intellectual property (IP) income. Some of IBM's technological breakthroughs are used exclusively in IBM products, while others are used by the company's licensees for their products when that new technology is not strategic to IBM's business goals. A third group is both used internally and licensed externally. 

In addition to these IP income sources, the company also generates value from its patent portfolio through cross-licensing arrangements and IP licensed in divestiture transactions. The value of these other two sources is not readily apparent in the financial results and Consolidated Statement of Earnings, because income on cross-licensing arrangements is recorded only to the extent cash is received. The value received by IBM for IP involving the sale of a business is included in the overall gain or loss from the divestiture, not in the separately displayed IP income amounts in financial results and Consolidated Statement of Earnings. 

In January 2005, IBM announced that it would pledge 500 of its patents for use by the open computing community, representing a major shift in the way IBM manages and deploys its intellectual property portfolio. IBM's intent is to help form an industry-wide ""patent commons,"" in which patents are used to establish a platform for further innovation in areas of broad interest to information technology developers and users. The pledge is applicable to any individual, community, or company working on or using software that meets the Open Source Initiative (OSI) definition of open source software. 

Integrated Supply Chain 

Just as IBM works to transform its clients' supply chains for greater efficiency and responsiveness to market conditions, IBM has undertaken a large-scale initiative to recast its own integrated supply chain as an on demand business operation, turning what had previously been an expense to be managed into a strategic advantage for the company and, ultimately, improved delivery and outcomes for its clients. IBM spends approximately $41 billion annually through its supply chain, procuring materials and services around the world. The company's supply, manufacturing and distribution operations are integrated in one operating unit that has reduced inventories, improved response to marketplace opportunities and external risks and converted fixed to variable costs. Simplifying and streamlining internal operations has improved sales force productivity and processes and thereby the experiences of the company's clients when working with IBM. Because some of the cost savings this unit generates are passed along to clients, they will not always result in a visible gross margin improvement in the company's Consolidated Statement of Earnings. While these efforts are largely concerned with product manufacturing and delivery, IBM is also applying supply chain principles to service delivery across its solutions and services lines of business. To accomplish this, IBM is creating a new labor resource management system&#151;based on a uniform taxonomy of skills&#151;that will enable the organization to more efficiently match its labor resources to the needs of IBM clients, deploy the right expertise quickly, and create a better short-term and long-term balance of labor supply and demand by comparing the demands of the market against the database of available skills. 

In addition to its own manufacturing operations, the company uses a number of contract manufacturing (CM) companies around the world to manufacture IBM-designed products. The use of CM companies is intended to generate cost efficiencies and reduce time-to-market for certain IBM products. Some of the company's relationships with CM companies are exclusive. The company has key relationships with Sanmina-SCI for the manufacture of some Intel-based products and with Solectron for a significant portion of the manufacturing operations of Global Asset Recovery Services&#151;an operation of Global Financing that restores end-of-lease personal computers and other IT equipment for resale. 

Significant Factors Affecting IBM's Business 

Forward-looking and Cautionary Statements: Certain statements contained in this Annual Report may constitute ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (""Reform Act""). The company may also make forward-looking statements in other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in materials delivered to stockholders and in press releases. In addition, the company's representatives may from time to time make oral forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. Words such as ""anticipates,"" ""believes,"" ""expects,"" ""estimates,"" ""intends,"" ""plans,"" ""projects,"" and similar expressions, may identify such forward-looking statements. The company assumes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. In accordance with the Reform Act, set forth below are cautionary statements that accompany those forward-looking statements. Readers should carefully review these cautionary statements as they identify certain important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements and from historical trends. The following cautionary statements are not exclusive and are in addition to other factors discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report, in the company's filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission or in materials incorporated therein by reference. 

Economic Environment and Corporate IT Spending Budgets: If overall demand for hardware, software and services changes, whether due to general economic conditions or a shift in corporate buying patterns, sales performance could be impacted. IBM's diverse portfolio of products and offerings is designed to gain market share in strong and weak economic climates. The company accomplishes this by not only having a mix of offerings with long-term cash and income streams as well as cyclical transaction-based sales, but also by continually developing competitive products and solutions and effectively managing a skilled resource base. IBM continues to transform itself to take advantage of shifting demand trends, focusing on client or industry-specific solutions, business performance and open standards. 

Internal Business Transformation and Efficiency Initiatives: IBM continues to drive greater productivity and cost savings as it transforms itself into an on demand enterprise. This includes the internal supply chain initiatives discussed above, as well as driving collaboration across the IBM enterprise to stimulate innovation and drive growth. Transformation efforts are improving the company's management of its costs worldwide: the rebalancing of skills, optimizing its workforce to drive growth, keeping the company's compensation programs competitive, and creating a cost efficient and cutting-edge IT infrastructure to support its transformation. IBM is extending its supply chain initiatives to labor costs and other internal processes. Continued success in this area will impact the company's cost structure improvements, as well as the amount of competitive leverage it can apply by passing savings along to clients. 

Innovation Initiatives: IBM invests for new and innovative capabilities, products and services. IBM has been moving away from commoditized categories of the IT industry and into areas in which it can differentiate itself through innovation and by leveraging its investments in R&#38;D. Examples include IBM's leadership position in the design and fabrication of ASICs; the design of smaller, faster and energy-efficient semiconductor devices; the design of ""grid"" computing networks that allow computers to share processing power; the transformation and integration of business processes; and the company's efforts to advance open technology standards and to engage with governments, academia, think tanks and nongovernmental organizations on emerging trends in technology, society and culture. In the highly competitive IT industry, with large diversified competitors as well as smaller and nimble single- technology competitors, IBM's ability to continue its cutting-edge innovation is critical to maintaining and increasing market share. IBM is managing this risk by more closely linking its R&#38;D organization to industry-specific and client-specific needs, as discussed in description of Business&#151;IBM Worldwide Organizations. 

Open Standards: The broad adoption of open standards is essential to the computing model for on demand business and is a significant driver of collaborative innovation across all industries. Without interoperability among all manner of computing platforms, the integration of any client's internal systems, applications and processes remains a monumental and expensive task. The broad-based acceptance of open standards&#151;rather than closed, proprietary architectures&#151;also allows the computing infrastructure to more easily absorb (and thus benefit from) new technical innovations. IBM is committed to fostering open standards because they are vital to the On Demand Operating Environment, and because their acceptance will expand growth opportunities across the entire business services and IT industry. There are a number of competitors in the IT industry with significant resources and investments who are committed to closed and proprietary platforms as a way to lock customers into a particular architecture. This competition will result in increased pricing pressure and/or IP claims and proceedings. IBM's support of open standards is evidenced by the enabling of its products to support open standards such as Linux, and the development of Rational software development tools, which can be used to develop and upgrade any other company's software products. 

Emerging Business Opportunities: The company is continuing to refocus its business on the higher value segments of enterprise computing&#151;providing technology and transformation services to clients' businesses. Consistent with that focus, the company continues to significantly invest in Emerging Business Opportunities, as a way to drive revenue growth and market share gain. Areas of investment 

include strategic acquisitions, primarily in software and services, information-based medicine, on demand retail, sensor and actuator solutions, Business Performance Transformation Services, key technologies (POWER5 and POWERBlade) and emerging growth countries such as China, Russia, India and Brazil. 

Protection of Intellectual Property: While the company's various proprietary intellectual property rights are important to its success, IBM believes its business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent or license, or any particular group of patents or licenses. IBM owns or is licensed under a number of patents, which vary in duration, relating to its products. Licenses under patents owned by IBM have been and are being granted to others under reasonable terms and conditions. These protections may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to the company's nor can there be any assurance that these protections will adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of the company's technology. Also, there can be no assurances that IBM will be able to obtain from third parties the licenses it needs in the future. 

Relationships with Critical Suppliers: IBM's business employs a wide variety of components, supplies, services and raw materials from a substantial number of suppliers around the world. Certain of the company's businesses rely on single or limited number of suppliers, although the company makes every effort to assure that alternative sources are available if the need arises. The failure of the company's suppliers to deliver components, supplies, services and raw materials in sufficient quantities and in a timely manner could adversely affect the company's business. 

Seasonality of Revenues: IBM's revenues are affected by such factors as the introduction of new products, the length of the sales cycles and the seasonality of technology purchases. As a result, the company's results are difficult to predict. These factors historically have resulted in lower revenue in the first quarter than in the immediately preceding fourth quarter. 

Local Legal and Economic Conditions: The company operates in more than 160 countries worldwide and derives more than half of its revenues from sales outside the United States. Changes in the laws or policies of the countries in which the company operates could affect the company's business in that country and the company's results of operations. The company's results of operations also could be affected by economic and political changes in those countries and by macroeconomic changes, including recessions and inflation. 

Environmental Matters. The company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise related to environmental protection, including the U.S. Superfund law. The company could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, if it were to violate or become liable under environmental laws and regulations. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company's capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position. 

Internal Controls. Effective internal controls are necessary for the company to provide reasonable assurance with respect to its financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud. If the company cannot provide reasonable assurance with respect to its financial reports and effectively prevent fraud, the company's brand and operating results could be harmed. Pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the company is required to furnish a report by management on internal control over financial reporting, including management's assessment of the effectiveness of such control. Internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Therefore, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. If the company fails to maintain the adequacy of its 

internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if the company experiences difficulties in their implementation, the company's business and operating results could be harmed, the company could fail to meet its reporting obligations, and there could be a material adverse effect on the company's stock price. 

Competitive Conditions: The company operates in businesses that are subject to intense competitive pressures. The company's businesses face a significant number of competitors, ranging from Fortune 50 companies to an increasing number of relatively small, rapidly growing and highly specialized organizations. The company believes that its combination of technology, performance, quality, reliability, price and the breadth of products and service offerings are important competitive factors. 

Intense competitive pressures could affect prices or demand for the company's products and services, resulting in reduced profit margins and/or loss of market opportunity. Unlike many of its competitors, the company has a portfolio of businesses and must allocate resources across these businesses while competing with companies that specialize in one or more of these product lines. As a result, the company may not fund or invest in certain of its businesses to the same degree that its competitors do, and these competitors may have greater financial, technical and marketing resources available to them than the businesses against which they compete. 

Volatility of Stock Prices: The company's stock price is affected by a number of factors, including quarterly variations in results, the competitive landscape, general economic and market conditions and estimates and projections by the investment community. As a result, like other technology companies, the company's stock price is subject to significant volatility. 

Dependence on and Compensation of Key Personnel: Much of the future success of the company depends on the continued service and availability of skilled personnel, including technical, marketing and staff positions. Experienced personnel in the information technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense. There can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully retain and attract the key personnel it needs. Many of the company's key personnel receive a total compensation package that includes equity awards. New regulations, volatility in the stock market and other factors could diminish the company's use, and the value, of the company's equity awards, putting the company at a competitive disadvantage or forcing the company to use more cash compensation. 

Currency and Customer Financing Risks: The company derives a significant percentage of its non-U.S. revenues from its affiliates operating in local currency environments and its results are affected by changes in the relative values of non-U.S. currencies and the U.S. dollar. Further, inherent in the company's customer financing business are risks related to the concentration of credit risk and the creditworthiness of the client, interest rate and currency fluctuations on the associated debt and liabilities and the determination of residual values. The company employs a number of strategies to manage these risks, including the use of derivative financial instruments. Derivatives involve the risk of non-performance by the counterparty. In addition, there can be no assurance that the company's efforts to manage these risks will be successful. 

Distribution Channels: The company offers its products directly and through a variety of third party distributors and resellers. Changes in the financial or business condition of these distributors and resellers could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring its products to market. 

Acquisitions and Alliances: The company has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions or enter into alliances from time to time. Acquisitions and alliances present significant challenges and risks relating to the integration of the business into the company, and there can be no assurances that the company will manage acquisitions and alliances successfully. 

Backlog: The value of unfilled orders is not a meaningful indicator of future revenues from the company's product offerings due to the significant proportion of revenue from services, the volume of products delivered from shelf inventories, and the shortening of product delivery schedules. With respect to the company's Global Services segment, in 2004 the company signed contracts totaling $43 billion, which contributed to a services backlog at December 31, 2004 of $111 billion, compared with $120 billion at the end of 2003.
