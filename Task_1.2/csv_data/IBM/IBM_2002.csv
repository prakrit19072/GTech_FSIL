1," Item 1. Business: 

International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) was incorporated in the State of New York on June 16, 1911, as the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Co. (C-T-R), a consolidation of the Computing Scale Co. of America, the Tabulating Machine Co., and The International Time Recording Co. of New York. In 1924, C-T-R adopted the name International Business Machines Corporation. 

IBM uses advanced information technology to provide customer solutions. The company operates primarily in a single industry using several segments that create value by offering a variety of solutions that include, either singularly or in some combination, technologies, systems, products, services, software and financing. 

Organizationally, the company's major operations comprise a Global Services segment; three hardware product segments&#151;Systems Group, Personal Systems Group and Technology Group; a Software segment; a Global Financing segment and an Enterprise Investments segment. The segments are determined based on several factors, including customer base, homogeneity of products, technology and delivery channels. 

IBM offers its products through its global sales and distribution organizations. The sales and distribution organizations have both a geographic focus (in the Americas, Europe/Middle East/Africa, and Asia Pacific) and a specialized and global industry focus. In addition, these organizations include a global sales and distribution effort devoted exclusively to small and medium businesses. IBM also offers its products through a variety of third party distributors and resellers, as well as through its on-line channels. 

While the company's various proprietary intellectual property rights are important to its success, IBM believes its business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent or license, or any particular group of patents or licenses. IBM owns or is licensed under a number of patents, which vary in duration, relating to its products. Licenses under patents owned by IBM have been and are being granted to others under reasonable terms and conditions. These protections may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative of the company's nor can there be any assurance that these protections will adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of the company's technology. Also, there can be no assurances that IBM will be able to obtain from third parties the licenses it needs in the future. 

IBM's businesses employ a wide variety of components, supplies and raw materials from a substantial number of suppliers around the world. Certain of the company's businesses rely on a single or limited number of suppliers, although the company makes every effort to assure that alternative sources are available if the need arises. The failure of the company's suppliers to deliver components, supplies and raw materials in sufficient quantities and in a timely manner could adversely affect the company's business. 

IBM's revenues are affected by such factors as the introduction of new products, the length of the sales cycles and the seasonality of technology purchases. As a result, the company's results are difficult to predict. These factors historically have resulted in lower revenue in the first quarter than in the immediately preceding fourth quarter. 

The value of unfilled orders is not a meaningful indicator of future revenues from the company's product offerings due to the significant proportion of revenue from services, the volume of products delivered from shelf inventories, and the shortening of product delivery schedules. With respect to the company's Global Services segment, in 2002 the company signed contracts totaling $53 billion, which contributed to a services backlog at December 31, 2002 of $112 billion, compared with $102 billion at the end of 2001. 

The company operates in businesses that are subject to intense competitive pressures. The company's businesses face a significant number of competitors, ranging from Fortune 50 companies to 

an increasing number of relatively small, rapidly growing and highly specialized organizations. The company believes that its combination of technology, performance, quality, reliability, price and the breadth of products and service offerings are important competitive factors. 

Intense competitive pressures could affect prices or demand for the company's products and services, resulting in reduced profit margins and /or loss of market opportunity. Unlike many of its competitors, the company has a portfolio of businesses and must allocate resources across these businesses while competing with companies that specialize in one or more of these product lines. As a result, the company may not fund or invest in certain of its businesses to the same degree that its competitors do and these competitors may have greater financial, technical and marketing resources available to them than the businesses against which they compete. 

The company operates in more than 160 countries worldwide and derives more than half of its revenues from sales outside the United States. Changes in the laws or policies of the countries in which the company operates could affect the company's business in that country and the company's results of operations. The company's results of operations also could be affected by economic and political changes in those countries and by macroeconomic changes, including recessions and inflation. 

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors approved the categories of all non-audit services performed by the company's independent accountants during the period covered by this report.

Forward-looking and Cautionary Statements: Certain statements contained in this Annual Report may constitute ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (""Reform Act""). The company may also make forward-looking statements in other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in materials delivered to stockholders and in press releases. In addition, the company's representatives may from time to time make oral forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. Words such as ""anticipates,"" ""believes,"" ""expects,"" ""estimates,"" ""intends,"" ""plans,"" ""projects,"" and similar expressions, may identify such forward-looking statements. The company assumes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. In accordance with the Reform Act, set forth below are cautionary statements that accompany those forward-looking statements. Readers should carefully review these cautionary statements as they identify certain important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements and from historical trends. The following cautionary statements are not exclusive and are in addition to other factors discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report, in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission or in materials incorporated therein by reference. 

New Products and the Pace of Technological Change: The company's results of operations depend on the continued successful development and marketing of new and innovative products and services. The development of new products and services requires significant capital investments by the company's various businesses and the success of these products and services depends on their acceptance by customers and business partners. Further, the company's businesses are characterized by rapid technological changes and corresponding shifts in customer demand, resulting in unpredictable product 

transitions and shortened life cycles and increasing emphasis on being first to market with new products and services. 

There can be no assurance that the company will successfully introduce new products and services, that these products and services will be accepted by customers, or that the company's businesses will recoup or realize a return on their capital investments. In addition, from time to time the company may experience difficulties or delays in the development, production or marketing of new products and services. 

Volatility of Stock Prices: The company's stock price is affected by a number of factors, including quarterly variations in results, the competitive landscape, general economic and market conditions and estimates and projections by the investment community. As a result, like other technology companies, the company's stock price is subject to significant volatility. 

Dependence on and Compensation of Key Personnel: Much of the future success of the company depends on the continued service and availability of skilled personnel, including technical, marketing and staff positions. Experienced personnel in the information technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense. There can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully retain and attract the key personnel it needs. Many of the company's key personnel receive a total compensation package that includes stock options and other equity awards. New regulations, volatility in the stock market and other factors could diminish the value of the company's equity awards, putting the company at a competitive disadvantage or forcing the company to use more cash compensation. 

Currency and Customer Financing Risks: The company derives a significant percentage of its non-U.S. revenues from its affiliates operating in local currency environments and its results are affected by changes in the relative values of non-U.S. currencies and the U.S. dollar. Further, inherent in the company's customer financing business are risks related to the concentration of credit risk and the creditworthiness of the customer, interest rate and currency fluctuations on the associated debt and liabilities and the determination of residual values. The company employs a number of strategies to manage these risks, including the use of derivative financial instruments. Derivatives involve the risk of non-performance by the counterparty. In addition, there can be no assurance that the company's efforts to manage these risks will be successful. 

Distribution Channels: The company offers its products directly and through a variety of third party distributors and resellers. Changes in the financial or business condition of these distributors and resellers could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring its products to market. 

Acquisitions and Alliances: The company has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions or enter into alliances from time to time. Acquisitions and alliances present significant challenges and risks relating to the integration of the business into the company, and there can be no assurances that the company will manage acquisitions and alliances successfully.
