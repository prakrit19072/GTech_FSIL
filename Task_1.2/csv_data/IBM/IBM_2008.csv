1," Item 1. Business: 

International Business Machines Corporation (IBM or the company) was incorporated in the State of New York on June 16, 1911, as the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Co. (C-T-R), a consolidation of the Computing Scale Co. of America, the Tabulating Machine Co. and The International Time Recording Co. of New York. Since that time, IBM has focused on the intersection of business insight and technological invention, and its operations and aims have been international in nature. This was signaled over 80 years ago, in 1924, when C-T-R changed its name to International Business Machines Corporation. And it continues today: The company creates business value for clients and solves business problems through integrated solutions that leverage information technology and deep knowledge of business processes. IBM solutions typically create value by reducing a client's operational costs or by enabling new capabilities that generate revenue. These solutions draw from an industry leading portfolio of consulting, delivery and implementation services, enterprise software, systems and financing. 

STRATEGY 

In IBM's view, today's networked economy has created a global business landscape and a mandate for business change. It also opens the opportunity to upgrade the efficiency and effectiveness of the global infrastructure through embedded information technology&#151;what IBM calls a ""smarter planet."" Smart airports, smart highways, smart supply chains are all possible. IBM is working with clients and governments around the world to explore these opportunities and implement new ideas. 

Integrated global economies have opened markets of new opportunity and new sources of skills. The Internet has enabled communication and collaboration across the world and brought with it a new computing model premised on continuous global connection. In that landscape, companies can distribute work and technology anywhere in the world. IBM continues to adjust its footprint toward emerging geographies, tapping their higher growth, providing the technology infrastructure they need and taking advantage of the talent pools they provide to better service the company's clients. 

At the same time, the current economic crisis increases the pressure on both businesses and governments around the world to adapt. The needs for additional transparency, security and efficiencies are clear. 

Given these opportunities and economic challenges, IBM is working with its clients to develop new business designs and technical architectures that allow their businesses the flexibility required to compete in this new landscape. IBM's strategy addresses this new era and delivers value to its clients through three strategic priorities: 

Focus on Open Technologies and High-Value Solutions 

A new computing model has emerged, replacing the PC-based, client/server approach. This new model is networked, modular, open and represents a fundamental shift in the technology requirements of the company's clients. IBM is well positioned to provide its enterprise clients the open technologies and high-value solutions they will need to compete. 

&#149; IBM is leveraging its leadership position in the convergence of software and services, in service oriented architecture (SOA), in virtualization, business intelligence and analytics, in open and modular information technology (IT)&#151;continuing its shift from commoditizing segments to higher value segments with better profit opportunity. &#149; The company continues to be a leading force in open source solutions to enable its clients to achieve higher levels of interoperability, cost efficiency and quality. 1 

Deliver Integration and Innovation to Clients 

Changes in the market have caused IBM's clients to seek flexibility and innovation in everything from technical architecture to their business model. In response, IBM is focused on delivering integration and innovation to its clients&#151;offering them technologies and services that support real value creation. 

&#149; IBM has a long heritage of transforming the business operations of large enterprises and has earned the trust to be their innovation partner and global integrator. &#149; The company has an extensive set of global assets and capabilities it is applying to improve services profitability, both for its clients and for itself. Become the Premier Globally Integrated Enterprise 

As global networks and technology capabilities change business economics, legacy business designs can quickly become noncompetitive. IBM believes a globally-integrated enterprise, designed for this new landscape, can compete effectively and will benefit from the opportunities offered. 

&#149; To reshape its business for the global economy, IBM has replaced vertical hierarchies with horizontally integrated teams. &#149; Across the business, the company has made significant investments in emerging markets, taking core processes and functions that were once managed regionally and shifting them to a globally integrated model. Looking forward, IBM is confident it understands the economic shift of globalization, the evolution of the new computing model and the powerful role of innovation in this new landscape. Its unique capabilities are well adapted to help the company's clients innovate and compete effectively in this new environment. 

BUSINESS MODEL 

The company's business model is built to support two principal goals: helping clients succeed in delivering business value by becoming more innovative, efficient and competitive through the use of business insight and IT solutions; and, providing long-term value to shareholders. The business model has been developed over time through strategic investments in capabilities and technologies that have the best long-term growth and profitability prospects based on the value they deliver to clients. 

The company's global capabilities include services, software, hardware, fundamental research and related financing. The broad mix of businesses and capabilities are combined to provide business insight and solutions for the company's clients. 

The business model is flexible, adapting to the continuously changing market and economic environment. The company has divested commoditizing businesses like personal computers and hard disk drives, and strengthened its position through strategic investments and acquisitions in higher value segments like business intelligence and analytics, virtualization and green solutions. In addition, the company has transformed itself into a globally integrated enterprise which has improved overall productivity and is driving investment and participation in the world's fastest growing markets. As a result, the company is a higher performing enterprise today than it was several years ago. 

The business model, supported by the company's long-term financial model, has enabled the company to deliver consistently strong earnings, cash flows and returns on invested capital in changing economic environments. 

BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND CAPABILITIES 

The company's major operations are comprised of: a Global Technology Services segment; a Global Business Services segment; a Software segment; a Systems and Technology segment; and a Global Financing segment. 

Global Services is a critical component of the company's strategy of providing IT infrastructure and business insight and solutions to clients. While solutions often include industry-leading IBM software and hardware, other suppliers' products are also used if a client solution requires it. Within Global Services there are two reportable segments: Global Technology Services and Global Business Services. 

Global Technology Services (GTS) primarily provides IT infrastructure services and business process services, delivering business value through the company's global scale, standardization and automation. 

GTS Capabilities

IBM WORLDWIDE ORGANIZATIONS 

The following worldwide organizations play key roles in IBM's delivery of value to its clients: 

&#149; Sales and Distribution 4 

&#149; Research, Development and Intellectual Property &#149; Integrated Supply Chain &#149; Integrated Technology Delivery &#149; Business Process Delivery Sales and Distribution 

IBM has a significant global presence, operating in over 170 countries, with an increasingly broad-based geographic distribution of revenue. The company's Sales and Distribution organization manages a strong global footprint, with dedicated country based operating units focused on delivering client value. Within these units, client relationship professionals work with integrated teams of consultants, product specialists and delivery fulfillment teams to improve clients' business performance. These teams deliver value by understanding the clients' business and needs, and then bring together capabilities from across IBM and an extensive network of Business Partners to develop and implement solutions. 

By combining global expertise with local experience, IBM's geographic structure enables dedicated management focus for local clients, speed in addressing new market opportunities and timely investments in emerging opportunities. The geographic units align industry-skilled resources to serve clients' agendas. IBM extends capabilities to mid-market client segments by leveraging industry skills with marketing, ibm.com and local Business Partner resources. 

In 2008, the company implemented a new growth markets organization to increase its focus on the emerging markets of Brazil, Russia, India and China and the additional opportunities around the world that have market growth rates greater than the global average&#151;countries within Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Latin America. The company's major markets include the United States, Canada, the U.K., France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland, Austria, Belgium, Finland, Greece, Ireland, the Netherlands, Portugal, Cyprus, Norway, Israel, Spain, the Bahamas and the Caribbean region. 

The majority of IBM's revenue, excluding the company's original equipment manufacturer (OEM) technology business, occurs in industries that are broadly grouped into six sectors: 

&#149; Financial Services: Banking, Financial Markets, Insurance &#149; Public: Education, Government, Healthcare, Life Sciences &#149; Industrial: Aerospace and Defense, Automotive, Chemical and Petroleum, Electronics &#149; Distribution: Consumer Products, Retail, Travel and Transportation &#149; Communications: Telecommunications, Media and Entertainment, Energy and Utilities &#149; Small and Medium Business: Mainly companies with less than 1,000 employees Research, Development and Intellectual Property 

IBM's research and development (R&#38;D) operations differentiate the company from its competitors. IBM annually spends approximately $6 billion for R&#38;D, focusing its investments on high-growth, high-value opportunities. As a result of innovations in these and other areas, IBM was once again awarded more U.S. patents in 2008 than any other company, the first company to achieve over 4,000 patents in a year. The company will continue to actively seek intellectual property protection for its innovations, while increasing emphasis on other initiatives designed to leverage its intellectual property leadership and promote innovation. 

In addition to producing world-class hardware and software products, IBM innovations are also a major differentiator in providing solutions for the company's clients through its services businesses. The company's investments in R&#38;D also result in intellectual property (IP) income of approximately $1 billion annually. Some of IBM's technological breakthroughs are used exclusively in IBM products, while others are licensed and may be used in either/both IBM products and/or the products of the licensee. While the company's various proprietary intellectual property rights are important to its success, IBM believes its business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent or license, or any particular group of patents or licenses. IBM owns or is licensed under a number of patents, which vary in duration, relating to its products. Licenses under patents owned by IBM have been and are being granted to others under reasonable terms and conditions. 

Integrated Supply Chain 

Consistent with the company's work with clients to transform their supply chains for greater efficiency and responsiveness to global market conditions, the company continues to derive business value from its own globally integrated supply chain, which provides a strategic advantage for the company to create value for clients. IBM leverages its supply chain expertise for clients through its supply-chain business transformation outsourcing service to optimize and help operate clients' end-to-end supply-chain processes, from procurement to logistics. 

IBM spends approximately $38 billion annually through its supply chain, procuring materials and services globally. The supply, manufacturing and logistics and customer fulfillment operations are integrated in one operating unit that has optimized inventories over time, improved response to marketplace opportunities and external risks and converted fixed costs to variable costs. Simplifying and streamlining internal processes has improved operations, sales force productivity and processes, and these actions have improved client satisfaction. 

Integrated Technology Delivery 

Integrated Technology Delivery (ITD) combines all of the worldwide service delivery capabilities for Strategic Outsourcing with strong local and regional management teams supported by a set of global competencies. ITD leverages the company's global scale and advanced technology to deliver standardized solutions that are automated, repeatable and globally integrated. Clients gain cost advantages, access to industry-leading skills and IBM's scale and overall flexibility. ITD manages the world's largest privately-owned IT infrastructure with employees in over 40 countries supporting over 450 data centers. 

Business Process Delivery 

Business Process Delivery (BPD) provides highly efficient, world-class delivery capabilities in IBM's business process delivery operations, which include Business Transformation Outsourcing, Business Process Outsourcing and Business Process Services. BPD has employees and delivery centers in over 40 countries worldwide.

"
1A," Item 1A. Risk Factors: 

&#160; Downturn in Economic Environment and Corporate IT Spending Budgets could impact the Company's Business: If overall demand for systems, software and services decreases, whether due to general economic conditions or a shift in corporate buying patterns, the company's revenue and profit could be impacted. 

&#160; The Company may not meet its Growth and Productivity Objectives under its Internal Business Transformation and Global Integration Initiatives: On an ongoing basis, IBM seeks to drive greater productivity, flexibility and cost savings by transforming and globally integrating its own business processes and functions to remain competitive and to enable scaling of resources in both emerging and more established geographical markets. These efforts may not yield their intended gains in overall efficiency and enablement of rapid scaling, which may impact the company's ability to meet its growth and productivity objectives. 

&#160; Failure of Innovation Initiatives could impact the Long-Term Success of the Company: IBM has been moving away from commoditized categories of the IT industry and into areas in which it can differentiate itself through innovation and by leveraging its investments in R&#38;D. If IBM is unable to continue its cutting-edge innovation in the highly competitive IT industry, the company could fail in its ongoing efforts to maintain and increase its market share and its profit margins. In addition, IBM has one of the strongest brand names in the world, and its brand and overall reputation could be negatively impacted by many factors, including if the company does not continue to be recognized for its industry-leading technology and solutions. If the company's brand image is tarnished by negative perceptions, our ability to attract and retain customers could be impacted. 

&#160; Risks from Investing in Growth Opportunities could impact the Company's Business: The company continues to invest significantly in growth opportunities, including higher-value segments of enterprise computing and dozens of emerging countries, including Brazil, Russia, India and China, to drive revenue growth and market share gains. Client adoption rates and viable economic models are uncertain in the high-value and rapidly-growing segments. In addition, as the company expands to capture emerging growth opportunities, it needs to rapidly secure the appropriate mix of trained, skilled and experienced personnel. In emerging growth countries, the developing nature presents potential political, social and economic risks from inadequate infrastructure, creditworthiness of customers and business partners, labor disruption and corruption, which could impact the company's ability to meet its growth objectives and to deliver to its clients around the world. 

&#160; IBM's Intellectual Property Portfolio may not prevent Competitive Offerings, and IBM may not be able to Obtain Necessary Licenses: The company's patents and other intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to the company's, nor can there be any assurance that the resources invested by the company to protect its intellectual property will be sufficient or that the company's intellectual property portfolio will adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of the company's technology. In addition, the company may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties, including non-practicing entities. Also, there can be no assurances that IBM will be able to obtain from third parties the licenses it needs in the future. 

&#160; Breaches of Data Protection could impact the Company's Business: The company's products and services, as well as its internal systems and processes, involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data, including personal information of employees, customers and others. Breaches in security could expose the company, its customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, resulting in litigation and potential liability for the company, as well as the loss of existing or potential customers and damage to the company's brand and reputation. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant. 

&#160; The Company's Revenues for Particular Periods are Difficult to Predict: IBM's revenues are affected by such factors as the introduction of new products and services, the length of the sales cycles, the structure of products and services contracts and the seasonality of technology purchases. As a result, the company's results are difficult to predict. These factors historically have resulted in lower revenue in the first quarter than in the immediately preceding fourth quarter. In addition, the high volume of products ordered at the end of each quarter, especially at the end of the fourth quarter, may affect IBM's ability to successfully ship all orders before the end of the quarter. 

&#160; Due to the Company's Global Presence, its Business and Operations could be impacted by Local Legal, Economic, Political and Health Conditions: The company is a globally integrated entity, operating in over 170 countries worldwide and deriving more than sixty percent of its revenues from sales outside the United States. Changes in the laws or policies of the countries in which the company operates, or inadequate enforcement of such laws or policies, could affect the company's business in that country and the company's overall results of operations. The company's results of operations also could be affected by economic and political changes in those countries and by macroeconomic changes, including recessions, inflation and currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and local currency. In addition, any widespread outbreak of an illness, pandemic or other local or global health issue, or any terrorist activities, could adversely affect customer demand and the company's operations and its ability to source and deliver products and services to its customers. 

&#160; The Company could incur Substantial Costs for Environmental Matters: The company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise related to environmental protection, including the U.S. Superfund law. The company could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, if it were to violate or become liable under environmental laws and regulations. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position, results of operations and competitive position. 

&#160; Tax Matters could impact the Company's Results of Operations and Financial Condition: The company is subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. IBM's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including, but not limited to, income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof, which could adversely impact the company's results of operations and financial condition in future periods. In addition, IBM is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. The company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on the company's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability. 

&#160; The Company's Results of Operations and Financial Condition could be negatively impacted by its U.S. and non-U.S. Pension Plans: Adverse equity market conditions and volatility in the credit markets may have an unfavorable impact on the value of the company's pension trust assets and its future estimated pension liabilities. As a result, the company's financial results in any period could be negatively impacted. In addition, in a period of an extended financial market downturn, the company could be required to provide incremental pension plan funding with resulting liquidity risk which could negatively impact the company's financial flexibility. IBM's 2008 Annual Report to Stockholders includes information about potential impacts from pension funding and the use of certain assumptions regarding pension matters. 

&#160; Ineffective Internal Controls could impact the Company's Business and Operating Results: The company's internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If the company fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if the company experiences difficulties in their implementation, the company's business and operating results could be harmed and the company could fail to meet its financial reporting obligations. 

&#160; The Company's Use of Accounting Estimates involves Judgment and could impact the Company's Financial Results: The company's most critical accounting estimates are described in the Management Discussion in IBM's 2008 Annual Report to Stockholders, under ""Critical Accounting Estimates."" In addition, as discussed in note O, ""Contingencies and Commitments"" in IBM's 2008 Annual Report to Stockholders, the company makes certain estimates under the provisions of SFAS No. 5, ""Accounting for Contingencies,"" including decisions related to legal proceedings and reserves. Because by definition these estimates and assumptions involve the use of judgment, actual financial results may differ. 

&#160; Competitive Conditions: The company operates in businesses that are subject to intense competitive pressures (see discussion about competition in Item 1. Business above). 

&#160; The Company Depends on Skilled Personnel and could be impacted by the loss of Critical Skills: Much of the future success of the company depends on the continued service, availability and integrity of skilled personnel, including technical, marketing and staff resources. Experienced personnel in the information technology industry are in high demand, and competition for their talents is intense. Changing demographics and labor work force trends may result in a loss of knowledge and skills as experienced workers retire. Further, many of IBM's key personnel receive a total compensation package that includes equity awards. New regulations, volatility in the stock market and other factors could diminish the company's use, and the value, of the company's equity awards, putting the company at a competitive disadvantage or forcing the company to use more cash compensation. 

&#160; The Company's Business could be impacted by its Relationships with Critical Suppliers: IBM's business employs a wide variety of components, supplies, services and raw materials from a substantial number of suppliers around the world. Certain of the company's businesses rely on single or a limited number of suppliers. Changes in the financial or business condition of these suppliers could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring products to market. Further, the failure of the company's suppliers to deliver components, supplies, services and raw materials in sufficient quantities and in a timely manner could adversely affect the company's business. In addition, any defective components, supplies or materials, or inadequate services, received from suppliers could reduce the reliability of the company's products and services and harm the company's reputation. 

&#160; The Company is exposed to Currency and Customer Financing Risks that could impact its Revenue and Business: The company derives a significant percentage of its revenues from its affiliates operating in local currency environments, and those results are affected by changes in the relative values of non-U.S. currencies and the U.S. dollar. Further, inherent in the company's customer financing business are risks related to the concentration of credit, client creditworthiness, interest rate and currency fluctuations on the associated debt and liabilities, the determination of residual values and the financing of other than traditional IT assets. The company employs a number of strategies to manage these risks, including the use of derivative financial instruments; derivatives involve the risk of non-performance by the counterparty. In addition, there can be no assurance that the company's efforts to manage its currency and customer financing risks will be successful. 

&#160; The Company's Financial Performance could be impacted by Changes in Market Liquidity Conditions and by Customer Credit Risk on Receivables: The company's financial performance is exposed to a wide 

variety of industry sector dynamics worldwide. The company's earnings and cash flows, as well as its access to funding, could be negatively impacted by changes in market liquidity conditions. IBM's 2008 Annual Report to Stockholders includes information about the company's liquidity position. The company's client base includes many worldwide enterprises, from small and medium businesses to the world's largest organizations and governments, with a significant portion of the company's revenue coming from global clients across many sectors. Most of the company's sales are on an open credit basis and the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its clients' financial conditions. If the company becomes aware of information related to the credit worthiness of a major customer, or, if future actual default rates on receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the company may have to adjust its reserves for uncollectible receivables, which could affect the company's consolidated net income in the period the adjustments are made. 

&#160; The Company's Reliance on Third Party Distribution Channels could impact its Business: The company offers its products directly and through a variety of third party distributors and resellers. Changes in the financial or business condition of these distributors and resellers could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring its products to market. 

&#160; Risks to the Company from Acquisitions and Alliances include Integration Challenges, Failure to Achieve Objectives, and the Assumption of Liabilities: The company has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions or enter into alliances from time to time. Acquisitions and alliances present significant challenges and risks relating to the integration of the business into the company, and there can be no assurances that the company will manage acquisitions and alliances successfully. The related risks include the company failing to achieve strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings, as well as the failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business and the assumption of liabilities related to litigation or other legal proceedings involving the acquired business. 

&#160; Risk Factors Related to IBM Securities: The company and its subsidiaries issue debt securities in the worldwide capital markets from time to time, with a variety of different maturities and in different currencies. The value of the company's debt securities fluctuates based on many factors, including the methods employed for calculating principal and interest, the maturity of the securities, the aggregate principal amount of securities outstanding, the redemption features for the securities, the level, direction and volatility of interest rates, changes in exchange rates, exchange controls, governmental and stock exchange regulations and other factors over which the company has little or no control. The company's ability to pay interest and repay the principal for its debt securities is dependent upon its ability to manage its business operations, as well as the other risks described under this Item 1A. entitled ""Risk Factors."" There can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage any of these risks successfully. 

The company also issues its common stock from time to time in connection with various compensation plans, contributions to its pension plan and certain acquisitions. The market price of IBM common stock is subject to significant volatility, due to other factors described under this Item 1A. entitled ""Risk Factors,"" as well as economic and geopolitical conditions generally, trading volumes, speculation by the press or investment community about the company's financial condition, and other factors, many of which are beyond the company's control. Since the market price of IBM's common stock fluctuates significantly, stockholders may not be able to sell the company's stock at attractive prices. 

In addition, changes by any rating agency to the company's outlook or credit ratings can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both the company's debt and equity securities. The company does not make a market in either its debt or equity securities and cannot provide any assurances with respect to the liquidity or value of such securities.
