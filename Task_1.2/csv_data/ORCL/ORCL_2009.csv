General 

&#160;

We are the world&#146;s largest enterprise software company. We develop, manufacture, market, distribute and service database and middleware software as well as applications software designed to help our customers manage and grow their business operations. 

&#160;

Our goal is to offer customers scalable, reliable, secure and integrated software solutions that improve transactional efficiencies, adapt to an organization&#146;s unique needs and allow better ways to access and manage information and automate business processes at a lower total cost of ownership. We seek to be an industry leader in each of the specific product categories in which we compete and to expand into new and emerging markets. 

&#160;

We believe our internal, or organic, growth and continued innovation with respect to our core database, middleware and applications technologies provide the foundation for our long-term strategic plan. In fiscal 2009, we invested $2.8 billion in research and development to enhance our existing portfolio of products and services and to develop new products, features and services. 

&#160;

An active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy. In recent years, we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of complementary companies, products, services and technologies. We believe our acquisition program supports our long-term strategic direction, strengthens our competitive position, expands our customer base, provides greater scale to accelerate innovation, grows our revenues and earnings, and increases stockholder value. We expect to continue to acquire companies, products, services and technologies. 

&#160;

On April 19, 2009, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Sun Microsystems, Inc. (Sun), a provider of enterprise computing systems, software and services, under which we have agreed to acquire all outstanding shares of Sun for $9.50 per share in cash. The estimated total purchase price for Sun is approximately $7.4 billion. The transaction is subject to Sun stockholder approval, regulatory clearances and other customary closing conditions. 

&#160;

Oracle Corporation was incorporated in 2005 as a Delaware corporation and is the successor to operations originally begun in June 1977. 

&#160;

Software and Services 

&#160;

We are organized into two businesses, software and services, which are further divided into five operating segments. Our software business is comprised of two operating segments: (1) new software licenses and (2) software license updates and product support. Our services business is comprised of three operating segments: (1) consulting, (2) On Demand and (3) education. Our software and services businesses represented 81% and 19% of our total revenues, respectively, in fiscal 2009, 80% and 20% of our total revenues, respectively, in fiscal 2008 and 79% and 21% of our 

total revenues, respectively, in fiscal 2007. See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our operating segments. 

&#160;

Software Business 

&#160;

New Software Licenses 

&#160;

The new software licenses operating segment of our software business includes the licensing of database and middleware software, which consists of Oracle Databases and Oracle Fusion Middleware, as well as applications software. Our technology and business solutions are based on an internet model comprised of interconnected databases, application servers, as well as mobile devices. This architecture enables users to access business data and applications through a web browser interface, and is designed to provide customers with the most efficient and cost effective method of managing business information and applications. 

&#160;

In an internet model, database servers manage and protect a customer&#146;s underlying business information, while application servers run the business applications that automate a myriad of business functions. Our architecture provides high quality business information and can be adapted to the specific needs of any industry or application. Oracle technology operates on both single server and clustered server configurations, which we refer to as &#147;grid&#148; software, and supports a choice of operating systems including Linux, Windows and UNIX. Our applications software is designed to help customers reduce the cost and complexity of their IT infrastructures by delivering industry solutions via an open, integrated and standards-based architecture that supports customer choice and reduces customer risk by automating business functions. 

&#160;

New software license revenues include fees earned from granting customers licenses to use our software products and exclude revenues derived from software license updates and product support. The standard end user software license agreement for our products provides for an initial fee to use the product in perpetuity based on a maximum number of processors, named users or other metrics. We also have other types of software license agreements restricted by the number of employees or the license term. New software license revenues represented 31%, 34% and 33% of total revenues in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 

&#160;

Database and Middleware Software 

&#160;

Our database and middleware software offerings provide a cost-effective, high-performance platform for running and managing business applications for mid-size businesses and large global enterprises. With an increasing focus by enterprises on reducing their total cost of IT infrastructure, our software is designed to accommodate demanding, non-stop business environments, using low cost server, storage and application grids that can incrementally scale as required. The ability to assign computing resources as required simplifies our customers&#146; IT capacity, planning and procurement to support all of their business applications. With an Oracle grid infrastructure, our customers can lower their investment in servers and storage, reduce their risk of data loss and IT infrastructure downtime and efficiently utilize available IT resources to meet business users&#146; quality of service expectations. New software license revenues from database and middleware products represented 72%, 68% and 71% of our new software license revenues in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 

&#160;

Databases 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; database software (including the sale of our Exadata database machine, which is hardware sold with preconfigured Oracle database software and is more fully described above); &#160; &#160; &#149; middleware (including application server, business intelligence, data integration, portal server and identity management); &#160; &#160; &#149; enterprise applications; &#160; &#160; &#149; content management and collaboration; &#160; &#160; &#149; development tools; &#160; &#160; &#149; enterprise management software; &#160; &#160; &#149; Software-as-a-Service; &#160; &#160; &#149; hosted and On Demand solutions; &#160; &#160; &#149; operating systems (by virtue of our distribution of Enterprise Linux); &#160; &#160; &#149; virtualization software; and &#160; &#160; &#149; consulting/systems integration. ##TABLE_END &#160;

Key competitive factors in each of the segments that we compete include: total cost of ownership, performance, scalability, functionality, ease of use, compliance with open standards, product reliability, Service-Oriented Architecture, security and quality of technical support. Our customers are also demanding less complexity and lower total cost in the implementation, sourcing, integration and ongoing maintenance of their enterprise software, which has led increasingly to our product offerings (particularly our database, middleware and applications) being viewed as a &#147;stack&#148; of software designed to work together in a standards-compliant environment. 

&#160;

Our product sales (and the relative strength of our products versus our competitors&#146; products) are also directly and indirectly affected by the following, among other things: 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; the broader &#147;platform&#148; competition between industry standard Java EE (formerly, J2EE) programming platform by Sun Microsystems, Inc. (Sun) and the .NET programming environment of Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft); &#160; &#160; &#149; operating system competition among, primarily, Microsoft&#146;s Windows Server, Unix (including Sun&#146;s Solaris, HP-UX from Hewlett Packard Company (HP) and AIX from International Business Machines Corporation (IBM)) and Linux; &#160; &#160; &#149; open source alternatives to commercial software, which are typically offered free of charge, subject to certain restrictions, and are readily available over the internet. Open source vendors will typically charge fees for commercial versions or unrestricted licenses of these products and for technical support of these products; and &#160; &#160; &#149; Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) offerings, which also continue to alter the competitive landscape. ##TABLE_END 10 

&#160;

The following lists of competitors are necessarily incomplete due to the nature of the enterprise software industry, where the competitive landscape is constantly evolving as firms emerge, expand or are acquired, as technology evolves and as customer demands and competitive pressures otherwise change: 

&#160;

In the sale of database software, scalability, reliability, availability and security are key competitive differentiators for us. Our competitors include IBM, Microsoft, Sybase, Inc. (Sybase), NCR Corporation&#146;s Teradata division, SAS Institute, Inc., Netezza Corporation, Progress Software Corporation (Progress Software) and open source databases such as Sun&#146;s MySQL, Ingres and PostgreSQL, among others. Our ability to continually innovate and differentiate our database product offerings has enabled us to maintain our leading position in database software over our competitors. 

&#160;

In the sale of middleware products, our offerings include application server and application grid, business intelligence, identity and access management, portal and user interaction, Service-Oriented Architecture and business process management, and data integration. Our ability to offer a full range of rich functionality in a standards-based, open architecture has been a key competitive differentiator which has contributed to rapid growth of our middleware solutions in recent years relative to our competitors. Our middleware competitors include IBM, Microsoft, SAP AG, Sun, Progress Software, Fujitsu Software Corporation, Hitachi Software Engineering Co., Ltd., open source vendors such as Red Hat, Inc. (JBoss), Apache Geronimo, Liferay, Inc., SpringSource, Inc., MuleSource, Inc. and JasperSoft Corporation, as well as several other competitors in each element of our packaged functions such as TIBCO Software, Inc., Software AG, SOA Software, Inc., Savvion, Inc., MicroStrategy, Inc., CA, Inc. (CA), Siemens AG, Courion Corporation, EMC Corporation (RSA), Informatica Corporation, Novell, Inc. (Novell), Lombardi Software, Inc. and Pegasystems, Inc., among others. 

&#160;

Competition in the sale of applications software, in particular, is multifaceted and subject to rapid change. We currently offer several application product lines that are designed to address functions applicable to customers across many industries (e.g., enterprise resource planning (ERP) or customer relationship management (CRM)), as well as applications specific to operations in particular industry verticals, such as retail, financial services, communications, tax and utilities, health sciences, public sector and others. One of the main competitive differentiators in applications software is our ability to combine &#147;best-of-breed&#148; software, suite software and our application integration architecture, without adding complexity for the end user. 

&#160;

Our applications offerings (including our On Demand/Hosted and SaaS offerings) typically compete with commercial software vendors&#146; pre-packaged applications, applications offered as On Demand, SaaS, or hosted offerings, open source applications, applications developed in-house by customers, applications that were custom developed by other software vendors or systems integrators, applications consisting of a variety of discrete pieces of functionality from multiple providers that have been customized and implemented by systems integrators or consultants (such as IBM Global Services and Accenture Ltd.) and business process outsourcers (such as Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (ADP), Fidelity Investments, Ceridian Corporation, Hewitt Associates, Inc., Accero Software (formerly Cyborg Systems Limited) and others). The variety of competing offerings is even more pronounced in industry verticals where complete industry solutions either do not exist or are addressed by combining offerings of multiple software offerings. As a result, our applications compete against offerings from the vendors listed above as well as SAP AG, IBM (through Maximo, MRO Software, Ascential Software, Cognos), Microsoft (through Dynamics GP, Dynamics NAV, Dynamics AX, Dynamics CRM, Dynamics Snap, Dynamics SL), Lawson Software, Inc., Infor Global Solutions (with numerous independent product lines coming from acquisitions including Agilisys, Baan, infor GmbH, SSA Global Technologies, Extensity and Datastream), Ariba, Inc., IFS AB, JDA Software Group, Inc., I2 Technologies, Inc., Manhattan Associates, Inc. The Sage Group plc, salesforce.com, Inc., Taleo Corporation, SuccessFactors, Inc., as well as many other application providers and point solution providers. 

&#160;

In the sale of content management and collaboration products, we compete with Microsoft, IBM (through Domino/Notes/FileNet), EMC Corporation (Documentum), Open Text Corporation, Autonomy Corporation plc (Interwoven), HP (through Tower Software), SAP AG and Vignette Corporation, as well as open source vendors such as Alfresco Software, Inc., among others. 

&#160;

In the sale of development tools, ease of use, standards-compliance and the level of abstraction (automated code generation) are key competitive differentiators. In this area, we compete against IBM (through WebSphere Studio), Microsoft (through VisualStudio.NET), Sun (through Sun Studio), Sybase (through PowerBuilder) and others, 

including Eclipse Foundation, Inc. (Eclipse), an open source vendor. The success of our development tools is closely related to the relative popularity of our other offerings (database and middleware and applications) compared to our competitors as well as the larger platform competition between Sun&#146;s Java and Microsoft&#146;s .NET. 

&#160;

In the sale of enterprise management software, we compete with BMC Software, Inc., Quest Software, Inc., IBM Tivoli, HP, CA, Compuware Corporation, Embarcadero Technologies, Inc., and open source vendors such as Hyperic, Inc. 

&#160;

In the sale of operating systems, we introduced a support and service offering for Red Hat&#146;s open source Linux operating system in fiscal 2007. This placed us in competition with others who offer support for the Linux operating system, including Red Hat, Novell, Inc. and Canonical Ltd. (through Ubuntu); as well as with the Unix operating systems of IBM, Sun, HP and others and the Windows Server operating systems of Microsoft. 

&#160;

In the sale of virtualization products, our offerings compete with those of VMware, Inc., IBM, Microsoft, Sun and Citrix Systems, Inc., among others, including other vendors of open source virtualization products. 

&#160;

In the sale of consulting and systems integration services, we both partner with and compete against Accenture Ltd., HP, IBM Global Services, Bearing Point, Inc., Capgemini Group, and many others (both large and small). 

&#160;

In the sale of many of our products, we also compete with products and features developed internally by customers and their IT staff. 

&#160;

Research and Development 

&#160;

We develop the substantial majority of our products internally. In addition, we have acquired technology through business acquisitions. We also purchase or license intellectual property rights in certain circumstances. Internal development allows us to maintain technical control over the design and development of our products. We have a number of United States and foreign patents and pending applications that relate to various aspects of our products and technology. While we believe that our patents have value, no single patent is essential to us or to any of our principal business segments. 

&#160;

Research and development expenditures were $2.8 billion, $2.7 billion and $2.2 billion, in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, or 12% of total revenues in each of the aforementioned fiscal years. As a percentage of new software license revenues, research and development expenditures were 39%, 36% and 37% in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Rapid technological advances in hardware and software development, evolving standards in computer hardware and software technology, changing customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements characterize the software markets in which we compete. We plan on continuing to dedicate a significant amount of resources to research and development efforts to maintain and improve our current product offerings including our database, middleware and applications software products. 

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

As of May 31, 2009, we employed approximately 86,000 full-time employees, including 20,000 in sales and marketing, 8,000 in software license updates and product support, 28,000 in services, 22,000 in research and development and 8,000 in general and administrative positions. Of these employees, approximately 28,000 were located in the United States and 58,000 were employed internationally. None of our employees in the United States is represented by a labor union; however, in certain international subsidiaries workers&#146; councils represent our employees.

&#160;

##TABLE_START "
1A," Item 1A. Risk Factors ##TABLE_END &#160;

We operate in a rapidly changing economic and technological environment that presents numerous risks, many of which are driven by factors that we cannot control or predict. The following discussion, as well as our &#147;Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates&#148; discussion in Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Item 7), highlights some of these risks. 

&#160;

The effects of the current recession and the recent global economic crisis may impact our business, results of operations, financial condition or stock price. The current recession and recent global economic crisis have caused a general tightening in the credit markets, lower levels of liquidity, increases in the rates of default and bankruptcy, and extreme volatility in credit, equity and fixed income markets. These macroeconomic developments could negatively affect our business, operating results or financial condition in a number of ways which, in turn, could adversely affect our stock price. 

&#160;

For example, current or potential customers may reduce their IT spending or be unable to fund software or services purchases, which could cause them to delay, decrease or cancel purchases of our products and services or not to pay us or to delay paying us for previously purchased products and services. 

In some financial markets, institutions may decrease or discontinue their purchase of the long-term customer financing contracts that we have traditionally sold on a non-recourse basis. As a result, we may hold more of these contracts ourselves or require more customers to purchase our products and services on a cash basis. 

&#160;

In addition, financial institution weakness or failures may cause us to incur increased expenses or make it more difficult either to utilize our existing debt capacity or otherwise obtain financing for our operations, investing activities or financing activities (including the financing of any future acquisitions and the timing and amount of any future dividend declarations or repurchases of our common stock or our debt). 

&#160;

Finally, our investment portfolio, which includes short-term debt securities, is generally subject to general credit, liquidity, counterparty, market and interest rate risks that may be exacerbated by the recent global financial crisis. If the banking system or the fixed income, credit or equity markets continue to deteriorate or remain volatile, our investment portfolio may be impacted and the values and liquidity of our investments could be adversely affected. 

&#160;

Economic, political and market conditions can adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, including our revenue growth and profitability. Our business is influenced by a range of factors that are beyond our control and that we have no comparative advantage in forecasting. These include: 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; general economic and business conditions; &#160; &#160; &#149; currency exchange rate fluctuations; &#160; &#160; &#149; the overall demand for enterprise software and services; &#160; &#160; &#149; governmental budgetary constraints or shifts in government spending priorities; and &#160; &#160; &#149; general political developments. ##TABLE_END &#160;

A general weakening of, or declining corporate confidence in, the global economy, or a curtailment in government or corporate spending could delay or decrease customer purchases. In addition, terrorist attacks around the world, the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and the potential for other hostilities in various parts of the world, potential public health crises and natural disasters continue to contribute to a climate of economic and political uncertainty that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, including our revenue growth and profitability. These factors generally have the strongest effect on our sales of new software licenses and related services and, to a lesser extent, also affect our renewal rates for software license updates and product support. 

&#160;

We may fail to achieve our financial forecasts due to inaccurate sales forecasts or other factors. Our revenues, and particularly our new software license revenues, are difficult to forecast, and, as a result, our quarterly operating results can fluctuate substantially. We use a &#147;pipeline&#148; system, a common industry practice, to forecast sales and trends in our business. Our sales personnel monitor the status of all proposals and estimate when a customer will make a purchase decision and the dollar amount of the sale. These estimates are aggregated periodically to generate a sales pipeline. Our pipeline estimates can prove to be unreliable both in a particular quarter and over a longer period of time, in part because the &#147;conversion rate&#148; or &#147;closure rate&#148; of the pipeline into contracts can be very difficult to estimate. A contraction in the conversion rate, or in the pipeline itself, could cause us to plan or budget incorrectly and adversely affect our business or results of operations. In particular, a slowdown in IT spending or economic conditions generally can unexpectedly reduce the conversion rate in particular periods as purchasing decisions are delayed, reduced in amount or cancelled. The conversion rate can also be affected by the tendency of some of our customers to wait until the end of a fiscal period in the hope of obtaining more favorable terms, which can also impede our ability to negotiate and execute these contracts in a timely manner. In addition, for newly acquired companies, we have limited ability to predict how their pipelines will convert into sales or revenues for one or two quarters following the acquisition, and their conversion rate post-acquisition may be quite different from their historical conversion rate. 

&#160;

A substantial portion of our new software license revenue contracts is completed in the latter part of a quarter and a significant percentage of these are large orders. Because our cost structure is largely fixed in the short term, revenue shortfalls tend to have a disproportionately negative impact on our profitability. The number of large new software license transactions also increases the risk of fluctuation in our quarterly results because a delay in even a small 

number of these transactions could cause our quarterly new software license revenues to fall significantly short of our predictions. 

&#160;

Our success depends upon our ability to develop new products and services, integrate acquired products and services and enhance our existing products and services. Rapid technological advances and evolving standards in computer hardware, software development and communications infrastructure, changing and increasingly sophisticated customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements characterize the enterprise software market in which we compete. If we are unable to develop new products and services, or to enhance and improve our products and support services in a timely manner or to position and/or price our products and services to meet market demand, customers may not buy new software licenses or purchase or renew software license updates and product support contracts. Renewals of these support contracts are an important factor in the growing software license update and product support segment of our business. In addition, IT standards from both consortia and formal standards-setting forums as well as de facto marketplace standards are rapidly evolving. We cannot provide any assurance that the standards on which we choose to develop new products will allow us to compete effectively for business opportunities in emerging areas. 

&#160;

We are currently building Oracle Fusion Applications, which are being designed to unify best-of-business capabilities from all Oracle applications in a complete suite. We have also announced that we intend to extend the life of many of our acquired products and will continue to provide long-term support for many of our acquired products, both of which require us to dedicate resources. If we do not develop and release these new or enhanced products and services within the anticipated time frames, if there is a delay in market acceptance of a new, enhanced or acquired product line or service, if we do not timely optimize complementary product lines and services or if we fail to adequately integrate, support or enhance acquired product lines or services, our business may be adversely affected. 

&#160;

Acquisitions present many risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of a transaction. In recent years, we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of companies, products, services and technologies. An active acquisition program is an important element of our overall corporate strategy, and we expect to continue to make similar acquisitions in the future, including our currently pending acquisition of Sun Microsystems, Inc. Risks we may face in connection with our acquisition program include: 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; our ongoing business may be disrupted and our management&#146;s attention may be diverted by acquisition, transition or integration activities; &#160; &#160; &#149; an acquisition may not further our business strategy as we expected, we may pay more than the acquired company or assets are ultimately worth or we may not integrate an acquired company or technology as successfully as we expected, which could adversely affect our business or operating results; &#160; &#160; &#149; we may have difficulties (i) managing an acquired company&#146;s technologies or lines of business or (ii) entering new markets, in each case where we have no or limited direct prior experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions; &#160; &#160; &#149; our operating results or financial condition may be adversely impacted by liabilities that we assume from an acquired company or technology or by other circumstances related to an acquisition, including claims related to an acquired business or technology from government agencies, terminated employees, customers, former stockholders or other third parties; pre-existing contractual relationships of an acquired company that we would not have otherwise entered into, the termination or modification of which may be costly or disruptive to our business; unfavorable revenue recognition or other accounting treatment as a result of an acquired company&#146;s practices; and intellectual property disputes; &#160; &#160; &#149; we may fail to identify or assess the magnitude of certain liabilities, shortcomings or other circumstances prior to acquiring a company or technology, which could result in unexpected litigation or regulatory exposure, unfavorable accounting treatment, unexpected increases in taxes due, a loss of anticipated tax benefits or other adverse effects on our business, operating results or financial condition; ##TABLE_END 16 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; we may not realize the anticipated increase in our revenues from an acquisition if a larger than predicted number of customers decline to renew software license updates and product support contracts, if we are unable to sell the acquired products to our customer base or if contract models of an acquired company do not allow us to recognize revenues on a timely basis; &#160; &#160; &#149; we may be unable to obtain timely approvals from, or may otherwise have certain limitations, restrictions, penalties or other sanctions imposed on us by, worker councils or similar bodies under applicable employment laws as a result of an acquisition, which could adversely affect our integration plans in certain jurisdictions; &#160; &#160; &#149; we may have difficulty incorporating acquired technologies or products with our existing product lines and maintaining uniform standards, architecture, controls, procedures and policies; &#160; &#160; &#149; we may have multiple and overlapping product lines as a result of our acquisitions that are offered, priced and supported differently, which could cause customer confusion and delays; &#160; &#160; &#149; we may have higher than anticipated costs in continuing support and development of acquired products; &#160; &#160; &#149; we may be unable to obtain required approvals from governmental authorities under competition and antitrust laws on a timely basis, if it all, which could, among other things, delay or prevent us from completing a transaction, otherwise restrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic goals of an acquisition or have other adverse effects on our current business and operations; &#160; &#160; &#149; our use of cash to pay for acquisitions may limit other potential uses of our cash, including stock repurchases, dividend payments and retirement of outstanding indebtedness; &#160; &#160; &#149; we may significantly increase our interest expense, leverage and debt service requirements if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition and we may have to delay or not proceed with a substantial acquisition if we cannot obtain the necessary funding to complete the acquisition in a timely manner or on favorable terms; &#160; &#160; &#149; we may experience additional and/or unexpected changes in how we are required to account for our acquisitions pursuant to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), including our adoption of FASB Statement No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations, in fiscal 2010, which could materially affect our consolidated financial statements; and &#160; &#160; &#149; to the extent that we issue a significant amount of equity securities in connection with future acquisitions, existing stockholders may be diluted and earnings per share may decrease. ##TABLE_END &#160;

The occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows, particularly in the case of a larger acquisition or several concurrent acquisitions. 

&#160;

Our international sales and operations subject us to additional risks that can adversely affect our operating results. We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from, and have significant operations, outside of the United States. Our international operations include software development, sales, customer support, consulting, On Demand and shared administrative service centers. 

&#160;

Compliance with international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. These laws and regulations include U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and local laws which also prohibit corrupt payments to governmental officials, data privacy requirements, labor relations laws, tax laws, anti-competition regulations, import and trade restrictions, and export requirements. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business. Any such violations could result in prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries, could delay or prevent potential acquisitions, and could also materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and our operating results. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these difficulties. We monitor our international operations and investigate allegations of improprieties relating to transactions and the way in which such transactions are 

recorded. Where circumstances warrant, we provide information and report our findings to government authorities, but no assurance can be given that action will not be taken by such authorities. 

&#160;

We are also subject to a variety of other risks and challenges in managing an organization operating in various countries, including those related to: 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; general economic conditions in each country or region; &#160; &#160; &#149; fluctuations in currency exchange rates; &#160; &#160; &#149; regulatory changes; &#160; &#160; &#149; political unrest, terrorism and the potential for other hostilities; &#160; &#160; &#149; public health risks, particularly in areas in which we have significant operations; &#160; &#160; &#149; longer payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable; &#160; &#160; &#149; overlapping tax regimes; &#160; &#160; &#149; our ability to repatriate funds held by our foreign subsidiaries to the United States at favorable tax rates; &#160; &#160; &#149; difficulties in transferring funds from certain countries; and &#160; &#160; &#149; reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries. ##TABLE_END &#160;

As the majority shareholder of Oracle Financial Services Software Limited (formerly i-flex solutions limited), a publicly traded Indian software company focused on the banking industry, we are faced with several additional risks, including being subject to local securities regulations and being unable to exert full control or obtain financial and other information on a timely basis. 

&#160;

We may experience foreign currency gains and losses. We conduct a significant number of transactions in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Changes in the value of major foreign currencies, particularly the Euro, Japanese Yen and British Pound relative to the U.S. Dollar can significantly affect revenues and our operating results. Our revenues and operating results are adversely affected when the dollar strengthens relative to other currencies and are positively affected when the dollar weakens. Our revenues and operating results in fiscal 2009 have been unfavorably affected by the recent strengthening U.S. Dollar relative to other major foreign currencies. 

&#160;

Our foreign currency transaction gains and losses, primarily related to sublicense fees and other agreements among us and our subsidiaries and distributors, are charged against earnings in the period incurred. We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain transaction and translation exposures in major currencies, but we will continue to experience foreign currency gains and losses in certain instances where it is not possible or cost effective to hedge our foreign currency exposures. 

&#160;

We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights. We rely on copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, controls and contractual commitments to protect our intellectual property rights. Despite our efforts, these protections may be limited. Unauthorized third parties may try to copy or reverse engineer portions of our products or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property. Any patents owned by us may be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. Any of our pending or future patent applications, whether or not being currently challenged, may not be issued with the scope of the claims we seek, if at all. In addition, the laws of some countries do not provide the same level of protection of our intellectual property rights as do the laws and courts of the United States. If we cannot protect our intellectual property rights against unauthorized copying or use, or other misappropriation, we may not remain competitive. 

&#160;

Third parties have claimed and, in the future, may claim infringement or misuse of intellectual property rights and/or breach of license agreement provisions. We periodically receive notices from, or have lawsuits filed against us by, others claiming infringement or other misuse of their intellectual property rights and/or breach of our agreements with them. We expect the number of such claims will increase as: 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; we continue to acquire companies; &#160; &#160; &#149; the number of products and competitors in our industry segments grows; ##TABLE_END 18 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; the functionality of products overlap; &#160; &#160; &#149; the use and support of third-party code (including open source code) becomes more prevalent in the software industry; and &#160; &#160; &#149; the volume of issued software patents continues to increase. ##TABLE_END &#160;

Responding to any such claim, regardless of its validity, could: 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; be time consuming, costly and result in litigation; &#160; &#160; &#149; divert management&#146;s time and attention from developing our business; &#160; &#160; &#149; require us to pay monetary damages or enter into royalty and licensing agreements that we would not normally find acceptable; &#160; &#160; &#149; require us to stop selling or to redesign certain of our products; &#160; &#160; &#149; require us to release source code to third parties, possibly under open source license terms; &#160; &#160; &#149; require us to satisfy indemnification obligations to our customers; or &#160; &#160; &#149; otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. ##TABLE_END &#160;

Specific patent infringement cases are discussed under Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

&#160;

We may lose key employees or may be unable to hire enough qualified employees. We rely on the continued service of our senior management, including our Chief Executive Officer and founder, members of our executive team and other key employees and the hiring of new qualified employees. In the software industry, there is substantial and continuous competition for highly skilled business, product development, technical and other personnel. In addition, acquisitions could cause us to lose key personnel of the acquired companies or at Oracle. We may also experience increased compensation costs that are not offset by either improved productivity or higher prices. We may not be successful in recruiting new personnel and in retaining and motivating existing personnel. With rare exceptions, we do not have long-term employment or non-competition agreements with our employees. Members of our senior management team have left Oracle over the years for a variety of reasons, and we cannot assure you that there will not be additional departures, which may be disruptive to our operations. 

&#160;

We continually focus on improving our cost structure by hiring personnel in countries where advanced technical expertise is available at lower costs. When we make adjustments to our workforce, we may incur expenses associated with workforce reductions that delay the benefit of a more efficient workforce structure. We may also experience increased competition for employees in these countries as the trend toward globalization continues, which may affect our employee retention efforts and/or increase our expenses in an effort to offer a competitive compensation program. Part of our total compensation program includes stock options which are an important tool in attracting and retaining employees in our industry. If our stock price performs poorly, it may adversely affect our ability to retain or attract employees. In addition, because we expense all stock-based compensation, we may in the future change our stock-based and other compensation practices. Some of the changes we consider from time to time include a reduction in the number of employees granted options, a reduction in the number of options granted per employee and a change to alternative forms of stock-based compensation. Any changes in our compensation practices or changes made by competitors could affect our ability to retain and motivate existing personnel and recruit new personnel. 

&#160;

We may need to change our pricing models to compete successfully. The intense competition we face in the sales of our products and services and general economic and business conditions can put pressure on us to change our prices. If our competitors offer deep discounts on certain products or services or develop products that the marketplace considers more valuable, we may need to lower prices or offer other favorable terms in order to compete successfully. Any such changes may reduce margins and could adversely affect operating results. Our software license updates and product support fees are generally priced as a percentage of our net new software license fees. Our competitors may offer lower percentage pricing on product updates and support, which could put pressure on us to further discount our new license prices. 

Any broad-based change to our prices and pricing policies could cause new software license and services revenues to decline or be delayed as our sales force implements and our customers adjust to the new pricing policies. Some of our competitors may bundle software products for promotional purposes or as a long-term pricing strategy or provide guarantees of prices and product implementations. These practices could, over time, significantly constrain the prices that we can charge for certain of our products. If we do not adapt our pricing models to reflect changes in customer use of our products or changes in customer demand, our new software license revenues could decrease. Additionally, increased distribution of applications through application service providers, including software-as-a-service (SaaS) providers, may reduce the average price for our products or adversely affect other sales of our products, reducing new software license revenues unless we can offset price reductions with volume increases. The increase in open source software distribution may also cause us to change our pricing models. 

&#160;

We may be unable to compete effectively within the highly competitive software industry. Many vendors develop and market databases, internet application server products, application development tools, business applications, collaboration products and business intelligence products that compete with our offerings. In addition, several companies offer business process outsourcing (BPO) and SaaS as competitive alternatives to buying software, and customer interest in BPO and SaaS solutions is increasing. Some of these competitors have greater financial or technical resources than we do. Our competitors that offer business applications and middleware products may influence a customer&#146;s purchasing decision for the underlying database in an effort to persuade potential customers not to acquire our products. We could lose customers if our competitors introduce new competitive products, add new functionality, acquire competitive products, reduce prices or form strategic alliances with other companies. Vendors that offer BPO or SaaS solutions may persuade our customers not to purchase our products. We may also face increasing competition from open source software initiatives, in which competitors may provide software and intellectual property for free. Existing or new competitors could gain sales opportunities or customers at our expense. 

&#160;

Disruptions of our indirect sales channel could affect our future operating results. Our indirect channel network is comprised primarily of resellers, system integrators/implementers, consultants, education providers, internet service providers, network integrators and independent software vendors. Our relationships with these channel participants are important elements of our marketing and sales efforts. Our financial results could be adversely affected if our contracts with channel participants were terminated, if our relationships with channel participants were to deteriorate, if any of our competitors enter into strategic relationships with or acquire a significant channel participant or if the financial condition of our channel participants were to weaken. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in maintaining, expanding or developing our relationships with channel participants. If we are not successful, we may lose sales opportunities, customers and revenues. 

&#160;

Charges to earnings resulting from acquisitions may adversely affect our operating results. In fiscal 2010, we will adopt FASB Statement No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations and FASB Staff Position (FSP) FAS 141(R)-1 Accounting for Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed in a Business Combinations That Arise from Contingencies . Accounting for our acquisitions pursuant to Statement 141(R) is significantly different than how we have historically accounted for our acquisitions under existing accounting principles and these differences could materially impact our results of operations or financial position. The more significant differences include how we account for restructuring liabilities associated with an acquisition, costs incurred to effect the acquisition, changes in estimates of income tax valuation allowances and liabilities for uncertain tax positions associated with an acquisition, and how we reflect goodwill adjustments in comparative financial statements, among others. A more thorough discussion of our accounting for these and other items is presented in the &#147;Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates&#148; section of Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Item 7). 

&#160;

For any business combination that is consummated pursuant to Statement 141(R), we will recognize the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in acquired companies generally at their acquisition date fair values and, in each case, separately from goodwill. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess amount of consideration transferred, which is also generally measured at fair value, and the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain. After we 

complete an acquisition, the following factors could result in material charges and adversely affect our operating results and may adversely affect our cash flows: 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; costs incurred to combine the operations of companies we acquire, such as employee retention, redeployment or relocation expenses; &#160; &#160; &#149; impairment of goodwill or intangible assets; &#160; &#160; &#149; amortization of intangible assets acquired; &#160; &#160; &#149; a reduction in the useful lives of intangible assets acquired; &#160; &#160; &#149; identification of assumed contingent liabilities after the measurement period (generally up to one year from the acquisition date) has ended; &#160; &#160; &#149; charges to our operating results to eliminate certain duplicative pre-merger activities, to restructure our operations or to reduce our cost structure; &#160; &#160; &#149; charges to our operating results due to changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and liabilities related to uncertain tax positions after the measurement period has ended; &#160; &#160; &#149; charges to our operating results resulting from expenses incurred to effect the acquisition; and &#160; &#160; &#149; charges to our operating results due to the expensing of certain stock awards assumed in an acquisition. ##TABLE_END &#160;

Substantially all of these costs will be accounted for as expenses that will decrease our net income and earnings per share for the periods in which those costs are incurred. Charges to our operating results in any given period could differ substantially from other periods based on the timing and size of our future acquisitions and the extent of integration activities. 

&#160;

Our periodic workforce restructurings can be disruptive. We have in the past restructured or made other adjustments to our workforce, including our direct sales force on which we rely heavily, in response to management changes, product changes, performance issues, acquisitions and other internal and external considerations. In the past, sales force and other restructurings have generally resulted in a temporary lack of focus and reduced productivity. These effects could recur in connection with future acquisitions and other restructurings and our revenues could be negatively affected. 

&#160;

We might experience significant errors or security flaws in our products and services. Despite testing prior to their release, software products frequently contain errors or security flaws, especially when first introduced or when new versions are released. The detection and correction of any security flaws can be time consuming and costly. Errors in our software products could affect the ability of our products to work with other hardware or software products, could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products and could adversely affect market acceptance of our products. If we experience errors or delays in releasing new products or new versions of products, we could lose revenues. In addition, we run our own business operations, Oracle On Demand and other outsourcing services, support and consulting services, on our products and networks and any security flaws, if exploited, could affect our ability to conduct internal business operations. End users, who rely on our products and services for applications that are critical to their businesses, may have a greater sensitivity to product errors and security vulnerabilities than customers for software products generally. Software product errors and security flaws in our products or services could expose us to product liability, performance and/or warranty claims as well as harm our reputation, which could impact our future sales of products and services. In addition, we may be legally required to publicly report security breaches of our services, which could adversely impact future business prospects for those services. 

&#160;

We may not receive significant revenues from our current research and development efforts for several years, if at all. Developing and localizing software is expensive and the investment in product development often involves a long return on investment cycle. We have made and expect to continue to make significant investments in software research and development and related product opportunities. Accelerated product introductions and short product life cycles require high levels of expenditures for research and development that could adversely affect our operating results if not offset by revenue increases. We believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant 

amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position. However, we do not expect to receive significant revenues from these investments for several years, if at all. 

&#160;

Our sales to government clients subject us to risks including early termination, audits, investigations, sanctions and penalties. We derive revenues from contracts with the United States government, state and local governments and their respective agencies, which may terminate most of these contracts at any time, without cause. 

&#160;

There is increased pressure for governments and their agencies, both domestically and internationally, to reduce spending. Our federal government contracts are subject to the approval of appropriations being made by the United States Congress to fund the expenditures under these contracts. Similarly, our contracts at the state and local levels are subject to government funding authorizations. 

&#160;

Additionally, government contracts are generally subject to audits and investigations which could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, refund of a portion of fees received, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business. 

&#160;

Business disruptions could affect our operating results. A significant portion of our research and development activities and certain other critical business operations is concentrated in a few geographic areas. We are a highly automated business and a disruption or failure of our systems could cause delays in completing sales and providing services, including some of our On Demand offerings. A major earthquake, fire or other catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our future operating results could be materially and adversely affected. 

&#160;

There are risks associated with our outstanding indebtedness. As of May 31, 2009, we had an aggregate of $10.2 billion of outstanding indebtedness that will mature between 2010 and 2038, and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our ability to pay interest and repay the principal for our indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations, generate sufficient cash flows to service such debt and the other factors discussed in this section. There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks successfully. 

&#160;

We may also need to refinance a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures. There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of our existing debt. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase. Should we incur future increases in interest expense, our ability to utilize certain of our foreign tax credits to reduce our U.S. federal income tax could be limited, which could unfavorably affect our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate. In addition, changes by any rating agency to our outlook or credit rating could negatively affect the value of both our debt and equity securities and increase the interest amounts we pay on outstanding or future debt. These risks could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 

&#160;

Adverse litigation results could affect our business. We are subject to various legal proceedings. Litigation can be lengthy, expensive and disruptive to our operations, and results cannot be predicted with certainty. An adverse decision could result in monetary damages or injunctive relief that could affect our business, operating results or financial condition. Additional information regarding certain of the lawsuits we are involved in is discussed under Note 17 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

&#160;

We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities. As a multinational corporation, we are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. 

&#160;

Changes in tax laws or tax rulings may have a significantly adverse impact on our effective tax rate. For example, proposals for fundamental U.S. international tax reform, such as the recent proposal by President Obama&#146;s Administration, if enacted, could have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate. 

&#160;

In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many intercompany transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities. Our intercompany transfer 

pricing is currently being reviewed by the IRS and by foreign tax jurisdictions and will likely be subject to additional audits in the future. We previously negotiated three unilateral Advance Pricing Agreements with the IRS that cover many of our intercompany transfer pricing issues and preclude the IRS from making a transfer pricing adjustment within the scope of these agreements. These agreements are effective for fiscal years through May 31, 2006. We have submitted to the IRS a request for renewal of this Advance Pricing Agreement for the years ending May 31, 2007 through May 31, 2011. However, these agreements do not cover all elements of our transfer pricing and do not bind tax authorities outside the United States. We have finalized one bilateral Advance Pricing Agreement, which was effective for the years ending May 31, 2002 through May 31, 2006 and we have submitted a renewal for the years ending May 31, 2007 through May 31, 2011. There can be no guarantee that such negotiations will result in an agreement. During the fiscal year ended May 31, 2009, we concluded an additional bilateral agreement to cover the period from June 1, 2001 through January 25, 2008. 

&#160;

Although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable, there is no assurance that the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. 

&#160;

We are also subject to non-income based taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net worth, property and goods and services taxes, in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities with respect to these non-income based taxes and may have exposure to additional non-income based tax liabilities. Our acquisition activities have increased our non-income based tax exposures. 

&#160;

Oracle On Demand and CRM On Demand may not be successful. We offer Oracle On Demand outsourcing services for our applications and database technology, delivered at our data center facilities, select partner data centers or customer facilities. We also offer CRM On Demand, which is a service offering that provides our customers with our CRM software functionality delivered via a hosted solution that we manage. These business models continue to evolve, and we may not be able to compete effectively, generate significant revenues, develop them into profitable businesses or maintain their profitability. We incur expenses associated with the infrastructures and marketing of our Oracle On Demand and CRM On Demand businesses in advance of our ability to recognize the revenues associated with these offerings. These businesses are subject to a variety of additional risks, including: 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; we manage critical customer applications, data and other confidential information through Oracle On Demand and CRM On Demand; accordingly, we face increased exposure to significant damage claims and risk to Oracle&#146;s brand and future business prospects in the event of system failures, inadequate disaster recovery or loss or misappropriation of customer confidential information; &#160; &#160; &#149; we may face regulatory exposure in certain areas such as data privacy, data security and export compliance; &#160; &#160; &#149; the laws and regulations applicable to hosted service providers are unsettled, particularly in the areas of privacy and security and use of global resources; changes in these laws could affect our ability to provide services from or to some locations and could increase both the costs and risks associated with providing the services; &#160; &#160; &#149; demand for these services may not meet our expectations and may be affected by customer and media concerns about security risks, international transfers of data, government or other third-party access to data, and/or use of outsourced services providers more generally; and &#160; &#160; &#149; our offerings may require large fixed costs for data centers, computers, network infrastructure, security and otherwise, and we may not be able to generate sufficient revenues to offset these costs and generate acceptable operating margins from these offerings. ##TABLE_END &#160;

Our stock price could become more volatile and your investment could lose value. All of the factors discussed in this section could affect our stock price. The timing of announcements in the public market regarding new products, product enhancements or technological advances by our competitors or us, and any announcements by us of acquisitions, major transactions, or management changes could also affect our stock price. Changes in the amounts and frequency of share repurchases or dividends could adversely affect our stock price. Our stock price is subject to speculation in the press and the analyst community, changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by financial analysts, changes in investors&#146; or analysts&#146; valuation measures for our stock, our credit ratings and market trends 

unrelated to our performance. A significant drop in our stock price could also expose us to the risk of securities class actions lawsuits, which could result in substantial costs and divert management&#146;s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business. 

&#160;

##TABLE_START "
7A," Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk ##TABLE_END &#160;

Cash, Cash Equivalents, Marketable Securities and Interest Income Risk 

&#160;

Our bank deposits and money market investments are generally held with a number of large, diverse financial institutions worldwide that we believe mitigates some of the exposures associated with our holdings with these financial institutions. In addition, we purchase high quality debt security investments, substantially all with relatively short maturities (see a description of our debt securities held in Notes 3 and 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and &#147;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#148; above). Therefore, interest rate movements generally do not materially affect the valuation of our debt security investments. Substantially all of our marketable securities are designated as available-for-sale. 

&#160;

Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest income that is generated from our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. For fiscal 2009, total interest income was $279 million with our investments yielding an average 2.23% on a worldwide basis. This interest rate level was down by 121 basis points from 3.44% for fiscal 2008. If overall interest rates fell by 100 basis points from our average of 2.23% during fiscal 2009, our annual interest income would decline by approximately $121 million, assuming consistent investment levels. The table below presents the cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities balances and the related weighted average 

interest rates for our investment portfolio at May 31, 2009. The cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities balances are recorded at their fair values at May 31, 2009. 

&#160;

&#160;

Interest Expense Risk 

&#160;

Our borrowings as of May 31, 2009 were $10.2 billion, consisting of $9.2 billion of fixed rate borrowings and $1.0 billion of floating rate senior notes that are due in May 2010 and bear interest at a floating rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus 0.06% per year (0.97% at May 31, 2009). We have entered into an interest rate swap arrangement to manage the economic effect of variable interest obligations associated with our 2010 floating rate senior notes so that the interest payable on the senior notes effectively became fixed at a rate of 4.59%, thereby reducing the impact of future interest rate changes on our future interest expense. We do not use interest rate swap arrangements for trading purposes. The critical terms of the interest rate swap agreement and the 2010 senior notes match, including the notional amounts, interest rate reset dates, maturity dates and underlying market indices. Accordingly, we have designated the swap as a qualifying instrument and are accounting for the swap as a cash flow hedge pursuant to FASB Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. The unrealized losses on the swap are included in accumulated other comprehensive income and the corresponding fair value payable is included in other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. The periodic interest settlements, which occur at the same interval as the interest payment and reset dates as the 2010 senior notes, are recorded as interest expense. 

&#160;

Foreign Currency Risk 

&#160;

Foreign Currency Transaction Risk 

&#160;

We transact business in various foreign currencies and have established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risks associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures. Under this program, increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts that we enter into to mitigate the possibility of foreign currency transaction gains or losses. These foreign currency exposures typically arise from intercompany sublicense fees and other intercompany transactions. Our forward contracts generally have terms of 90 days or less. We do not use foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes. All outstanding foreign currency forward contracts are marked to market at the end of the period with unrealized gains and losses resulting from fair value changes included in non-operating income, net (the effective portion of our Yen net investment hedge described below is included in stockholders&#146; equity). Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to currency fluctuations will depend on the currency exchange rates and other factors in effect as the contracts mature. The notional amounts of foreign currency forward contracts to purchase and sell U.S. Dollars in exchange for other major international currencies were $860 million and $1.1 billion, respectively, and to purchase Euros in exchange for other major international currencies was &#128;142 million ($198 million), as of May 31, 2009. The net unrealized gains of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts were $2 million at May 31, 2009. Net foreign exchange transaction (losses) gains included in non-operating income, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations were $(65) million, $17 million and $17 million in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 

&#160;

Foreign Currency Translation Risk 

&#160;

Fluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets and liabilities that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon translation of these amounts into U.S. Dollars. In particular, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we report in U.S. Dollars for a significant portion of the cash held by these 

subsidiaries is subject to translation variance caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period (the offset to which is recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheet). We hedge net assets of certain international subsidiaries from foreign currency exposure and provide a discussion in &#147;Foreign Currency Net Investment Risk&#148; below.

As the U.S. Dollar strengthened against most major international currencies during fiscal 2009, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we reported in U.S. Dollars for these subsidiaries as of May 31, 2009 declined relative to what we would have reported using a constant currency rate as of May 31, 2008. As reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows, the effect of exchange rate changes on our reported cash and cash equivalents balances in U.S. Dollars for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 was a (decrease) increase of $(501) million, $437 million, and $149 million, respectively. The following table includes the U.S. Dollar equivalent of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities denominated in foreign currencies at May 31, 2009.

If overall foreign currency exchange rates in comparison to the U.S. Dollar weakened by 10%, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities we would report in U.S. Dollars would decrease by approximately $498 million, assuming constant foreign currency cash, cash equivalent and marketable security balances.

Foreign Currency Net Investment Risk 

&#160;

We hedge the net assets of certain of our international subsidiaries (net investment hedges) using foreign currency forward contracts to offset the translation and economic exposures related to our investments in these subsidiaries. We measure the effectiveness of our net investment hedges by using the changes in spot exchange rates because this method reflects our risk management strategies, the economics of those strategies in our financial statements and better manages interest rate differentials between different countries. Under this method, the change in fair value of the forward contract attributable to the changes in spot exchange rates (the effective portion) is reported in stockholders&#146; equity to offset the translation results on the net investments. The remaining change in fair value of the forward contract (the ineffective portion, if any) is recognized in non-operating income, net. 

&#160;

Net gains (losses) on investment hedges reported in stockholders&#146; equity, net of tax effects, were $(41) million, $(53) million and $28 million in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Net gains on investment hedges reported in non-operating income, net were $10 million, $23 million and $28 million in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 

&#160;

At May 31, 2009, we had one net investment hedge in Japanese Yen. The Yen net investment hedge minimizes currency risk arising from net assets held in Yen as a result of equity capital raised during the initial public offering and secondary offering of our majority owned subsidiary, Oracle Japan. The notional amount of our net investment hedge was $694 million and had a nominal fair value as of May 31, 2009.
