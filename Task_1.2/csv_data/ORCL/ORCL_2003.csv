1," Item 1. Business ##TABLE_END General We are the world&#146;s largest enterprise software company. We develop, manufacture, market, distribute and service database software and infrastructure software, including application server, collaborative software and development tools, that help our customers manage and grow their businesses and operations. We also offer an integrated suite of business applications software. Our goal is to provide a wide range of customers with scalable, reliable and secure database technology software and integrated business applications software that give them transactional efficiency and quality information at a low total cost of ownership. We seek to be an industry leader in each of the specific product categories in which we compete and to expand into new and emerging markets. In fiscal 2004, we focused on improving our market position and enhancing our portfolio of products and services as described below. Oracle Corporation was incorporated in 1986 as a Delaware corporation and is the successor to operations originally begun in June 1977. Tender Offer for PeopleSoft, Inc. On June 9, 2003, we commenced an unsolicited $16.00 per share, or approximately $5.1 billion, tender offer for all of the outstanding shares of common stock of PeopleSoft, Inc., a Delaware corporation. On June 18, 2003, we increased the value of our tender offer to $19.50 per share or approximately $6.2 billion. In connection with PeopleSoft&#146;s acquisition of J.D. Edwards &#38; Company, PeopleSoft issued additional shares of its stock, which increased the value of our offer to approximately $7.5 billion. On February 4, 2004, we increased the value of our tender offer to $26.00 per share or approximately $9.4 billion. On May 14, 2004, we revised the value of our tender offer to $21.00 per share, or approximately $7.7 billion. Our tender offer will expire on July 16, 2004, unless we extend the offer. In connection with the tender offer, we have been named as a defendant in various legal proceedings, including civil antitrust lawsuits filed by the U.S. Department of Justice and several state attorneys general seeking to block our acquisition of PeopleSoft, and we may be a party to additional legal proceedings in the future. While the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe we have meritorious defenses to these actions, and we will vigorously defend them. Software and Services We are organized into two businesses, which are further organized into five operating segments. Our software business is comprised of two operating segments: (1) new software licenses and (2) software license updates 1 and product support. Our services business is comprised of three operating segments: (1) consulting, (2) advanced product services, and (3) education. Our software business represented 79%, 76% and 73% of total revenues and our services business represented 21%, 24% and 27% of total revenues in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 

Software Business New Software Licenses New software licenses include the licensing of database technology software and applications software. Our software platform is based on an internet architecture comprised of interconnected database servers, application servers and client computers or devices running web browsers. This architecture permits end users to access business data and applications through standard web browsers, while allowing enterprises to manage business information and applications from centralized locations. Database servers manage the underlying business information, while application servers run the business applications. These servers are typically managed by professional information technology managers. In contrast, traditional client/server computing architectures require that each client computer run and manage its own applications and also be updated every time an application changes. We believe that the network-centric design of our software for internet computing improves network performance and data quality and helps our customers better control installation, maintenance and training costs associated with information technology infrastructure. Our integrated, component-based architecture can be adapted to the specific needs of any industry and is supported on many different operating systems, including Linux, UNIX and Windows. New software license revenues include all fees earned from granting customers licenses to use our software products and exclude revenues derived from software license updates and product support. The standard end user software license agreement for our products provides for an initial fee to use the product in perpetuity based on a maximum number of processors, named users or other metrics. We also have other types of software license agreements restricted by the number of employees or the license term. New software license revenues also include other revenues, which consist of documentation and miscellaneous revenues. New software license revenues represented 35%, 35% and 36% of total revenues in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Oracle Information Architecture The Oracle Information Architecture, which underlies our database, application server and applications, is integrated, modular, and based on industry standards. The architecture is designed to eliminate information fragmentation and to provide companies with the consolidated information they need to run their businesses more effectively. Unlike proprietary, mainframe-type architectures, the Oracle Information Architecture is open and provides basic integration across multiple applications, whether Oracle&#146;s or others, thereby allowing users to create a single, integrated information technology infrastructure. The foundation for the Oracle Information Architecture is a grid computing infrastructure that dynamically provisions processing power and storage to keep applications running smoothly and without interruption. Database Technology Our database technology software provides a platform for developing and deploying applications on the internet and on corporate intranets. Database technology software products include database management software, application server software, collaboration software and development tools that allow users to create, retrieve and modify the various types of data stored in a computer system. In fiscal 2004, we released a new version of our database technology software, Oracle 10g. New software license revenues from database technology products represented 29%, 28% and 29% of total revenues and 82%, 81% and 80% of new software license revenues in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 2 Oracle Database The Oracle relational database management system is a key component of our internet platform and enables the storage, manipulation and retrieval of relational, object-relational, multi-dimensional and other types of data. The Oracle Database can run applications with a very high degree of scalability and reliability across multiple computers clustered together. Designed for enterprise grid computing, Oracle Database 10g with Real Application Clusters acts as a single database in a cluster of computers that are linked together. Oracle Database 10g does not require data to be separated on multiple computers. Customers can simply add computers to the cluster, and the database software adapts to utilize the additional computing resources, thereby significantly improving application scalability and availability without requiring users to modify their applications. Customers can achieve significant cost savings by scaling up and eliminating fail-over servers, and by using lower-cost hardware as the basis of the cluster, instead of larger, more expensive computers. Oracle Database 10g also contains self-diagnosing and self-tuning features, as well as features that facilitate customers&#146; ability to build, deploy and manage internet applications at lower costs. The key features of the Oracle Database include improved database availability, functionality, enhanced security capabilities and an integrated infrastructure for building business intelligence applications. Oracle Application Server The Oracle Application Server, a consolidated software platform based on industry standards, makes it easier for developers to build and deploy web services, web sites and portals and web-based applications. The Oracle Application Server supports a range of development languages and tools, including the latest J2EE technologies. Designed for grid computing, Oracle Application Server 10g incorporates clustering and caching technology, which significantly increases application reliability, performance, security and scalability. The Oracle Application Server comes with an integrated set of business intelligence software including Oracle Discoverer, Oracle Reports and Oracle Clickstream. Oracle Discoverer is an intuitive web-based ad hoc query, reporting and analysis tool for end users. Oracle Reports offers an enterprise-reporting tool for the production of high quality reports. Oracle Clickstream provides a facility to analyze web site traffic. Additionally, the new Identity Management option for Oracle Application Server 10g Standard Edition makes it easier for companies to manage multiple identities and access privileges, which helps to safeguard information, critical systems and applications against unauthorized access. The Oracle Application Server also includes Portal, which allows personalized portal sites to be rapidly developed and deployed, all with single sign on and security. Portal sites are assembled using &#147;portlets,&#146; which are reusable interface components that provide access to web-based resources such as applications, business intelligence reports, syndicated content feeds and outsourced software services. With the wireless capability of Oracle Application Server 10g Enterprise Edition, portal sites can be made available to any wireless device. Oracle Collaboration Suite Oracle Collaboration Suite is a single, integrated suite that manages email and voicemail messages, facsimiles, calendaring, file sharing, search and workflow. The Oracle Collaboration Suite centralizes administration and lowers operating costs by consolidating email and file servers. Additionally, users are provided with one folder for their email, files, voicemail and facsimile messages. The Oracle Collaboration Suite is built on the Oracle 9i Database and Oracle 9i Application Server, supports enterprise-scale implementations, and offers high-availability features like rapid server failover, disaster recovery and automated backup. With Oracle Collaboration Suite, users access all their communications content via desktop applications, the internet, personal digital assistants or mobile phones, improving communication and collaboration. 3 Oracle Developer Suite Oracle Developer Suite is an integrated suite of development tools designed to facilitate rapid development of internet database applications and web services. The Developer Suite contains application development and business intelligence tools and is built on internet standards such as Java, J2EE, XML and HTML. The Developer Suite includes Oracle JDeveloper, a Java development environment for modeling, building, debugging and testing enterprise-class J2EE applications and web services. In addition, the suite contains Oracle Designer, a tool that allows developers to model business processes and automatically generate enterprise database applications, and Oracle Forms Developer, a development tool for building database applications that can be deployed unchanged in both internet and client/server based environments. The Developer Suite also includes Oracle Warehouse Builder to consolidate fragmented data and metadata (machine understandable information for the web) pulled from packaged applications, custom applications and legacy applications. Oracle Warehouse Builder enables developers to graphically design the multidimensional database schema and to automatically generate and load the data warehouse. Oracle Data Hub Data hubs serve as repositories for metadata about the enterprise, defining key business objects such as customers, products, and employees. The Oracle Customer Data Hub is a packaged solution that enables companies to create a single enterprise customer database by consolidating customer data from heterogeneous systems. After the data is consolidated into the central customer data store, it can be standardized, cleansed and enriched by use of embedded functionality and then used by other applications with near-real-time synchronization. The Oracle Customer Data Hub can operate independently of Oracle applications and can be deployed even in non-Oracle environments. The Oracle Customer Data Hub differs from a data warehouse in that it provides near-real-time access to customer data without the need to move data between the transaction system and a data warehouse. The Oracle Customer Hub is designed to help companies gain a complete and consistent view of a customer across all transaction systems. We envision the creation of additional hubs to consolidate information related to products, suppliers, employees, or other metadata from a variety of systems and applications. Applications We offer a fully integrated suite of applications, the Oracle E-Business Suite, built upon a unified information architecture. Applications software includes financials, projects, marketing, sales, order management, procurement, supply chain, manufacturing, service and human resources, which can be accessed with standard web browsers and can be used to automate business processes and provide business intelligence. New software license revenues from applications software represented 6%, 7% and 7% of total revenues and 18%, 19% and 20% of new software license revenues in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The Oracle E-Business Suite, which is offered as a suite or on a component basis, provides integrated enterprise information that enables companies to manage their business cycles on a global basis and to solve end-to-end business problems. The Oracle E-Business Suite utilizes Oracle&#146;s full technology stack, including database, application server and developer tools. The E-Business Suite is an open architecture, which can be integrated to third party and legacy applications that exist in a customer&#146;s environment. The Oracle E-Business Suite applications combine business functionality with innovative technologies, such as workflow and self-service applications, that enable users to lower the cost of their business operations by providing customers, suppliers and employees with self-service internet access to both transaction processing and critical business information. Self-service applications automate a variety of business functions such as customer service and support, procurement, expense reporting and reimbursement. The Oracle E-Business Suite can also help companies automate and improve business processes associated with financials, projects, marketing, sales, order management, procurement, supply chain, manufacturing, service and human resources. 4 Available in approximately 30 languages, Oracle&#146;s E-Business Suite applications also allow companies to operate in multiple currencies and to support both global and local business practices and legal requirements. Software License Updates and Product Support Software license updates provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades, maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period, which is typically one year. Product support includes internet access to technical content, as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel. Product support is provided by local offices, as well as by our four global support centers located around the world. Software license updates and product support are generally priced as a percentage of the net new software license fees. Software license updates can be purchased separately from product support; however, only customers who purchase software license updates can purchase product support. Substantially all of our customers purchase software license updates and product support when they acquire new software licenses. In addition, substantially all of our customers renew their software license updates and product support contracts annually. Software license updates and product support revenues represented 44%, 41% and 37% of total revenues in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. We believe that software license updates and product support revenues will continue to grow as we anticipate that a substantial majority of our customers will renew their product support contracts and the sale of new software license will increase our subscription base. Services Business Consulting Through Oracle Consulting, we globally deploy professionals who specialize in the design, implementation, deployment, upgrade and migration services for our database technology and applications software. We focus on implementing software with a number of consulting accelerators such as preconfigured business flows, all of which increase the pace at which our customers achieve value from our applications. Our consulting services help customers consolidate their information technology operations, integrate disparate systems and increase the security of their data assets. Consulting revenues represented 16%, 19% and 21% of total revenues in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Advanced Product Services Advanced product services are comprised of Oracle On Demand (formerly Oracle Outsourcing) and advanced product support services. Oracle On Demand offers services for our products through our three core offerings; E-Business Suite On Demand, Technology On Demand and Collaboration Suite On Demand. Customers may choose to have the core services delivered either at Oracle, where we manage our applications, database, as well as the system and hardware administration, or at a Customer designated location, which allows us to manage our applications and database remotely. With either approach, by allowing us to manage availability, security, performance, change and problem management for our software, customers can lower information technology costs and improve their business efficiency. Our advanced product support services assist customers in configuration and performance analysis, personalized support and annual on-site technical services. Advanced product services revenues represented 3%, 2% and 3% of total revenues in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Education Through Oracle University, we provide training to customers, partners and employees as part of our mission of accelerating the adoption of Oracle technology around the world. Operating out of approximately 860 Oracle classrooms and 400 delivery partner classrooms, Oracle University trains more than 400,000 students in 65 countries each year on Oracle technology. Our training is provided primarily through public and private instructor-led classroom events, but is also made available through a variety of online courses and self paced media training on CD-Roms. Oracle University&#146;s curriculum is entirely Oracle-based, covering the latest Oracle Database, Application Server, Developer Suite, Collaboration Suite and E-Business Applications Suite 5 products. At any given time, there are more than 300 instructor-led courses, more than 1,000 hours of online course content and more than 200 CD-Rom based course titles available. This curriculum is continuously updated for the latest versions of our software products. Education revenues represented 2%, 3% and 3% of total revenues in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 

Marketing and Sales Sales Distribution Channels In the United States, we market our products and services primarily through our own direct sales and service organization. Sales and service employees are based in our headquarters and in field offices located in approximately 55 metropolitan areas. Outside the United States, we market our products and services primarily through our subsidiary sales and service organizations. Our subsidiaries license and support our products in their local countries as well as within other foreign countries where we do not operate through a direct sales subsidiary. We also market our products worldwide through indirect channels. The companies that comprise our indirect channel network are members of the Oracle Partner Network. Our partners resell our products or combine our database, development tools and applications with computer hardware, software application packages or services for subsequent redistribution and/or implementation. The Oracle Partner Network allows us to pursue new business opportunities through partners as well as with direct customers. Partners in the program include consultants, education providers, internet service providers, network integrators, resellers, independent software vendors and system integrators/implementers. Partners can also participate in the Oracle Technology Network. This program is specifically designed for the database administrator, internet developer and applications suite user communities. We provide applications, technology, education and technical support that enable our partners to effectively integrate our products into their business offerings. The combination of the Oracle technology stack, the Oracle E-Business Suite and our partners&#146; expertise broadens our exposure in new markets. International We have offices in more than 70 countries and conduct business worldwide. We believe our geographic diversity allows us to draw on business and technical expertise from a worldwide workforce, provides stability to our operations and revenue streams to offset geography-specific economic trends and offers us an opportunity to take advantage of new markets for maturing products. Our results of operations could be affected by economic and political uncertainty or changes in the laws or policies in the countries in which we operate and by macroeconomic changes, including currency rate fluctuations, recessions and inflation. Seasonality General economic conditions have an impact on our business and financial results. The markets in which we sell our products and services have, at times, experienced weak economic conditions that have negatively affected revenues. Our quarterly results reflect distinct seasonality in the sale of our products and services, as our revenues are typically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter and lowest in our first fiscal quarter. See &#147;Quarterly Results of Operations&#148; in the Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of this Form 10-K for a more complete description of the seasonality of our revenues and expenses. Customers Our customer base consists of a significant number of businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions and resellers. Our primary industry markets include defense and government, education, financial services, technology, transportation, life sciences, telecommunications, manufacturing and healthcare. No single customer accounted for 10% or more of revenues in fiscal 2004, 2003 or 2002. 6 Competition The software industry is intensely competitive and rapidly evolving. We compete in various markets including the database management system, data warehouse, collaboration, application server, development tools, applications, consulting, education and outsourcing markets. Total cost of ownership, performance, functionality, ease of use, product reliability, security and quality of technical support are the key competitive factors that face us in each of the markets in which we compete. Our principal software competitors in the database management system and collaboration markets are International Business Machines Corporation and Microsoft Corporation. In the data warehousing market, our online analytical processing products compete primarily with those of Business Objects S.A., Cognos Incorporated, Hyperion Solutions Corporation and NCR Corporation. In the application server market, our competitors include BEA Systems, Inc., IBM, Microsoft and SAP Aktiengesellschaft Systeme. In the development tools market, we compete primarily against Borland Software Corporation, IBM and Microsoft. In the applications market, we compete against Lawson Software, Inc., Microsoft, PeopleSoft, SAP, Siebel Systems, Inc. and many other application providers, as well as outsourced and in-house solutions for customers. We may also face competition in the open source software initiatives, in which companies such as JBoss and MySQL provide software and intellectual property free over the internet. Among the business process outsourcers that we compete against include Automatic Data Processing, Inc., Fidelity Investments, Ceridian Corporation, Hewitt-Cyborg Limited and others. In the consulting and technical outsourcing markets, we periodically compete against Accenture Ltd., Electronic Data Systems Corporation, IBM Global Services and other smaller service providers. Research and Development We develop the majority of our products internally. In certain circumstances, we also purchase or license intellectual property rights. Internal development allows us to maintain technical control over the design and development of our products. We have a number of United States and foreign patents and pending applications that relate to various aspects of our products and technology. While we believe that our patents have value, no single patent itself is essential to us or to any of our principal business segments. Research and development expenditures were 13%, 12% and 11% of total revenues in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. As a percentage of new software license revenues, research and development expenditures were 36%, 36% and 31% in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Rapid technological advances in hardware and software development, evolving standards in computer hardware and software technology, changing customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements characterize the software markets in which we compete. We plan on continuing to dedicate a significant amount of resources to research and development efforts to maintain and improve our competitive position in these markets. Employees As of May 31, 2004, we employed 41,658 full-time employees, including 24,760 in sales and services, 757 in marketing, 11,436 in research and development and 4,705 in general and administrative positions. Of these employees, 16,659 were located in the United States and 24,999 were employed internationally. None of our employees in the United States are represented by a labor union; however, in certain international subsidiaries our employees are represented by worker councils. We have not experienced any work stoppages and believe that our employee relations are good. Available Information Our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to reports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, are available free of charge on our Investor Relations web site at www.oracle.com/investor as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.

All of our fixed income investments, with the exception of auction rate securities, are classified as held-to-maturity, and therefore, are reported on the balance sheet at amortized cost. Auction rate securities are classified as available-for-sale and reported on the balance sheet at par value, which equals market value, as the rate on such securities re-sets generally every 7 to 28 days. Consequently, interest rate movements do not affect the balance sheet valuation of the fixed income investments. Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect our interest income that is generated from our investments. For fiscal 2004, total interest income was $117.5 million with investments yielding an average 1.46% on a worldwide basis. This interest rate level was down approximately 46 basis points from 1.92% in fiscal 2003. If a similar decline in overall interest rates (46 basis points) were to occur in fiscal 2005, our interest income would decline approximately $37.0 million, assuming consistent investment levels. Table of Investment Securities: The table below presents the cash, cash equivalent and investment balances, related weighted average interest rates and maturities for our investment portfolio at May 31, 2004. The cash, cash equivalent and investment balances approximate fair value at May 31, 2004: ##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Amortized Principal Weighted Average (Dollars in millions) Amount Interest Rate Cash and cash equivalents

&#160; $ 3,073 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END During fiscal 1997, we issued $150.0 million in 6.72% senior notes due in February 2004 and $150.0 million in 6.91% senior notes due in February 2007. In February 2002, we entered into two interest-rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the interest obligations associated with these senior notes so that the interest payable on the senior notes effectively becomes variable based on the three month LIBOR set on February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15 of each year until maturity. The notional amount of the 41 interest rate swaps and their termination date match the principal amounts and maturities of the outstanding senior notes. In the third quarter of fiscal 2004, we repaid our $150.0 million senior notes that matured in February 2004 and settled the corresponding interest rate swap. Our remaining interest rate swap reduced the effective interest rate on our 6.91% senior notes to 3.31% as of May 31, 2004. The fair value of the interest rate swap is $7.2 million at May 31, 2004 and is included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 

Foreign Currency Transaction Risk. We transact business in various foreign currencies and have established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risk associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures. Under this program, increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the forward contracts, to mitigate the possibility of foreign currency transaction gains or losses. These foreign currency exposures typically arise from intercompany sublicense fees and other intercompany transactions. Our forward contracts generally have terms of 90 days or less. We do not use forward contracts for trading purposes. All outstanding foreign currency forward contracts (excluding our Yen equity hedge) are marked to market at the end of the period with unrealized gains and losses included in other income, net. Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to currency fluctuations will depend on the currency exchange rates and other factors in effect as the contracts mature. Net foreign exchange transaction losses included in other income, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations were $20.9 million, $1.0 million and $27.4 million in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts was $(0.7) million and $(0.6) million as of May 31, 2004 and 2003. The table below presents the notional amounts (at contract exchange rates) and the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates for the outstanding forward contracts as of May 31, 2004. Notional weighted average exchange rates are quoted using market conventions where the currency is expressed in currency units per United States dollar. All of our forward contracts mature in ninety days or less as of May 31, 2004.

Periodically, we hedge the net assets of certain international subsidiaries (net investment hedges) using foreign currency forward contracts to offset the translation and economic exposures related to our investments in these subsidiaries. We measure the ineffectiveness of net investment hedges by using the changes in spot exchange rates because this method reflects our risk management strategies, the economics of those strategies in our financial statements and better manages interest rate differentials between different countries. Under this method, the change in fair value of the forward contract attributable to the changes in spot exchange rates (the effective portion) is reported in stockholders&#146; equity to offset the translation results on the net investments. The remaining change in fair value of the forward contract (the ineffective portion) is recognized in other income, net. At May 31, 2004, we had one net investment hedge in Japanese Yen. The Yen investment hedge minimizes currency risk arising from net assets held in Yen as a result of equity capital raised during the initial public offering and secondary offering of Oracle Japan. The fair value of our Yen investment hedge was $1.4 million and $(0.6) million as of May 31, 2004 and 2003. The Yen investment hedge has a notional amount of $653.8 million and an exchange rate of 111.0 Yen for each United States dollar. Net losses on investment hedges reported in stockholders&#146; equity were $38.4 million, $44.7 million and $6.9 million in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Net gains on investment hedges reported in other income, net were $7.5 million, $8.9 million and $6.4 million in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
