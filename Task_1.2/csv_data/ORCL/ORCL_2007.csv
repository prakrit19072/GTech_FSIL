General 

&#160;

We are the world&#146;s largest enterprise software company. We develop, manufacture, market, distribute and service database and middleware software as well as applications software designed to help our customers manage and grow their business operations. We also provide support for the Linux open source operating system through our Oracle Unbreakable Linux Support program, which provides our customers with our industry-leading global support programs for Linux. 

&#160;

Our goal is to offer customers scalable, reliable, secure and integrated software systems that provide transactional efficiencies, adapt to an organization&#146;s unique needs and allow better ways to access and manage information at a lower total cost of ownership. We seek to be an industry leader in each of the specific product categories in which we compete and to expand into new and emerging markets. In fiscal 2007, we focused on strengthening our competitive position and enhancing our existing portfolio of products and services as well as acquiring and integrating businesses. 

&#160;

An active acquisition program is an important element of our corporate strategy. In the last three fiscal years, we have invested over $25 billion, in the aggregate, to acquire a number of companies, products, services and technologies, including the acquisition of PeopleSoft, Inc., Siebel Systems, Inc. and Hyperion Solutions Corporation. Typically, the significant majority of our integration activities related to an acquisition are substantially complete in the United States within three to six months after the closing of the acquisition. We believe our acquisition program supports our long-term strategic direction, strengthens our competitive position, expands our customer base and provides greater scale to accelerate innovation, grow our earnings and increase stockholder value. We expect to continue to acquire companies, products, services and technologies. 

&#160;

Oracle Corporation was incorporated in 2005 as a Delaware corporation and is the successor to operations originally begun in June 1977. 

&#160;

Software and Services 

&#160;

We are organized into two businesses, software and services, which are further divided into five operating segments. Our software business is comprised of two operating segments: (1) new software licenses and (2) software license updates and product support. Our services business is comprised of three operating segments: (1) consulting, (2) On Demand and (3) education. Our software and services businesses represented 79% and 21% of our total revenues, respectively, in fiscal 2007 and 80% and 20% of our total revenues, respectively, in both fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005. See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our operating segments. 

Software Business 

&#160;

New Software Licenses 

&#160;

New software licenses include the licensing of database and middleware software, which consists of Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware, as well as applications software. Our technology and business solutions are based on an internet model comprised of interconnected database servers, application servers, web servers and computers as well as mobile devices running web browsers. This architecture enables users to access business data and applications through a universally adopted web browser interface, while providing enterprises the most efficient and cost effective method of managing business information and applications. 

&#160;

In an internet model, database servers manage and protect the underlying business information, while application servers run the business applications that automate a myriad of business functions. We have focused on concepts such as global single instance application deployment that involve fewer, high quality databases of important business information, rather than dozens or hundreds of disparate databases that are difficult to synchronize and coordinate. Our integrated architecture provides high quality business information and can be adapted to the specific needs of any industry or application. Oracle technology operates on single server or clustered server configurations, and supports a choice of operating systems including Linux, UNIX and Windows. In fiscal 2007, we introduced a program to support the Linux open source operating system for our customers&#146; information technology (IT) platforms. 

&#160;

New software license revenues include fees earned from granting customers licenses to use our software products and exclude revenues derived from software license updates and product support. The standard end user software license agreement for our products provides for an initial fee to use the product in perpetuity based on a maximum number of processors, named users or other metrics. We also have other types of software license agreements restricted by the number of employees or the license term. New software license revenues represented 33%, 34% and 35% of total revenues in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. 

&#160;

Database and Middleware Software 

&#160;

Our grid software provides a cost-effective, high-performance platform for running and managing business applications for small and mid-size businesses and large global enterprises. With an increasing focus by enterprises on reducing their total cost of IT infrastructure, Oracle&#146;s grid software is designed to accommodate demanding, non-stop business environments, using clusters of low cost servers and storage that can incrementally scale as required. The unique ability to assign computing resources as required simplifies our customers&#146; computing capacity, planning and procurement in order to support all of their business applications. With an Oracle grid infrastructure, our customers can lower their investment in IT hardware, reduce their risk of IT infrastructure downtime and easily cope with sudden increases in demand on their IT environments during high traffic periods. New software license revenues from database and middleware products represented 71%, 73% and 81% of new software license revenues in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. 

&#160;

Database 

&#160;

As the world&#146;s most popular database, Oracle&#146;s relational database enables the secure storage, manipulation and retrieval of all forms of data including structured data that resides in business applications, XML data, analytics data, spatial data and other unstructured data such as documents, spreadsheets and images. Designed for enterprise grid computing, the Oracle Database is available in four editions: Express Edition, Standard Edition One, Standard Edition and Enterprise Edition. All editions are built using the same underlying code, which means that database applications can easily scale from small, single processor servers to clusters of multi-processor servers. 

&#160;

Options to Oracle Database Enterprise Edition are available to meet specific requirements in the areas of performance and scalability, high availability, security and compliance, data warehousing, unstructured data integration and systems management. Examples of these options include: Oracle Real Application Clusters, which consolidates a single, scalable and fault tolerant database that is shared across an interconnected cluster of servers (also available on our other database editions); Oracle Partitioning, which supports large transaction processing and business intelligence database systems and cost effectively manages data throughout its lifecycle; and Oracle 

Warehouse Builder connectors, which design, build and populate data warehouses from a variety of legacy repositories. 

&#160;

Enterprise Manager 

&#160;

Oracle Enterprise Manager is designed to deliver top-down applications management. Our customers use Oracle Enterprise Manager to monitor and manage their applications and underlying software infrastructure, including both Oracle and non-Oracle infrastructure products. Oracle Enterprise Manager can be used to manage packaged applications, such as Siebel, PeopleSoft, Oracle E-Business Suite or custom applications including service-oriented applications. In addition to managing Oracle software infrastructure products including the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager also supports third-party infrastructure products. 

&#160;

Oracle Enterprise Manager is designed to monitor service levels and performance, automate tasks, manage configuration information, and provide change management in a unified way across groups of computers or grids. Oracle Enterprise Manager&#146;s provisioning automates the discovery, tracking and scheduling of software patches and allows IT administrators to apply patches without taking their system down. Additionally, IT administrators can manage systems from anywhere through an HTML browser or through wireless PDAs. 

&#160;

Secure Enterprise Search 

&#160;

Oracle Secure Enterprise Search provides an internet-like search experience to users searching secure content inside the enterprise. Oracle Secure Enterprise Search indexes and searches public, private and shared content across internal and external web sites, databases, file servers, document repositories, enterprise content management systems, applications and portals. Oracle Secure Enterprise Search has built-in functionality that permits users to see only search results leading to information for which they have authorized access. The product features a simple web interface allowing for efficient administration and management.

&#160;

General economic conditions have an impact on our business and financial results. The markets in which we sell our products and services have, at times, experienced weak economic conditions that have negatively affected revenues. Our quarterly results reflect distinct seasonality in the sale of our products and services, as our revenues are typically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter and lowest in our first fiscal quarter. See &#147;Quarterly Results of Operations&#148; in Item 7 for a more complete description of the cyclicality and seasonality of our revenues and expenses. 

&#160;

Customers 

&#160;

Our customer base consists of a significant number of businesses of many sizes and industries, government agencies, educational institutions and resellers. No single customer accounted for 10% or more of revenues in fiscal 2007, 2006 or 2005. 

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The enterprise software industry is intensely competitive and evolving rapidly. We compete in various segments of this industry including database software, middleware (business intelligence, application integration, portal server, J2EE application server, development tools and identity management), collaboration, development tools, enterprise applications, consulting/systems integration and operating systems, among others. Total cost of ownership, performance, functionality, ease of use, standards-compliance, product reliability, security and quality of technical support are key competitive factors that face us in each of the areas in which we compete. Our customers are also demanding less complexity and lower cost in the implementation, sourcing, integration and ongoing maintenance of their enterprise software, which has led increasingly to our product offerings (database, middleware and applications) being viewed as a &#147;stack&#148; of software designed to work together. Our product sales (and the relative strength of our products versus our competitors) are also affected by the broader &#147;platform&#148; competition between industry standard Java (J2EE) and Microsoft Corporation&#146;s .NET programming environments and by operating system competition between Windows Server, Unix (Sun Solaris, HP-UX and IBM AIX) and Linux. Open source alternatives to commercial software, such as MySQL AB in database, Red Hat, Inc. (JBoss) in middleware, and SugarCRM Inc. in applications, are also impacting the competitive environment. These products are typically offered free of charge and are readily available over the internet. Finally, &#147;on demand&#148; offerings, such as those from salesforce.com, continue to alter the competitive landscape. 

&#160;

In the sale of database software and related tools, scalability, reliability, availability and security are key competitive differentiators for us. Our competitors include International Business Machines Corporation (IBM), Microsoft, Sybase, Inc., NCR Corporation&#146;s Teradata division, SAS Institute, Inc., Informatica Corporation, and the open source databases, MySQL and PostgreSQL, among others. Our ability to continually innovate and differentiate our database offering has enabled us to maintain our leading position in database software over our competitors. 

In the sale of middleware products, our offerings include business intelligence, application integration, business process management (BPM), service oriented architecture, portal, J2EE application server, development tools and identity management software. Our ability to offer a full range of rich functionality in a standards-based, open architecture has been a key competitive differentiator. Our competitors include IBM, Microsoft, BEA Systems, Inc., SAP AG, Sun Microsystems Inc., Sybase and open source vendors such as Red Hat (JBoss), Apache Geronimo and ObjectWeb, as well as other competitors in each element of our packaged functions. Business intelligence competitors include Actuate Corporation, Business Objects S.A., Cognos Incorporated, MicroStrategy, Inc., SAS Institute, TIBCO Software, Inc. (Spotfire), open source vendors Netezza Corporation, and others. Application server competitors include Borland Software Corporation, Fujitsu Software Corporation, Hitachi Software Engineering Co., Ltd., Adobe Systems Incorporated and others. Enterprise Application Integration competitors include Software AG (webMethods), TIBCO, IONA Technologies PLC, Sonic Software Corporation, Sun Microsystems and others. BPM competitors include Lombardi Software, Inc., Savvion, Inc., Pegasystems Inc. and others. Enterprise portal vendors include Vignette Corporation, Novell, Inc., Fujitsu, and others. Identity management vendors include IBM, CA, Inc., Sun Microsystems and Hewlett-Packard Company, among others. Open source vendors Red Hat and Novell are also increasingly bundling middleware functionality with their respective Linux distributions. Our middleware solutions have experienced rapid growth in recent years relative to our competitors. In the sale of collaboration products, we compete primarily with Microsoft (Exchange/Outlook), IBM (Domino/Notes), Novell (Groupwise) and Cisco Systems, Inc. (WebEx). In addition, we compete in the related content management markets with EMC Corporation (Documentum), IBM (FileNet), Percussion Software, Inc. and Vignette, among others. 

&#160;

In the sale of development tools, ease of use, standards-compliance and the level of abstraction (automated code generation) are key competitive differentiators. We compete against IBM (WebSphere Studio), Microsoft 8 (VisualStudio.NET), Sun Microsystems (Sun Studio), Sybase (PowerBuilder) and others, including Eclipse Foundation, Inc. (Eclipse), an open source vendor. The success of our development tools is closely related to the relative popularity of our platform (database and middleware) compared to our competitors, as well as the larger competition between Java and Microsoft&#146;s .NET. 

&#160;

The sale of applications software, in particular, is changing rapidly due to the development and deployment of service oriented architectures and web services, application integration middleware as well as &#147;software as a service&#148; offerings, such as those from salesforce.com and RightNow Technologies Inc. in CRM applications. As a result of our acquisitions of PeopleSoft and Siebel, we presently offer several product lines, which are suited for different needs of customers in different industries. We compete against SAP, Lawson Software, Inc., Infor Global Solutions GmbH (SSA Global Technologies, Extensity), Microsoft Dynamics (Great Plains, Solomon, Axapta, Navision), Sage, Inc. and many other application providers. These include numerous point solution providers such as Epicor Software Corporation (accounting), SunGard Data Systems Inc. (treasury), Kronos Incorporated (time and attendance), Taleo Corporation (recruitment), Callidus Software Inc. (compensation), Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (HR, payroll and business process outsourcing), Ariba, Inc. (procurement), i2 Technologies, Inc. (supply chain management), IBM (MRO Software) (enterprise asset management), DSCI Corporation (logistics), Broadvision, Inc. (marketing), Kana Software, Inc. (analytics), salesforce.com (sales force automation) and Amdocs Limited (customer service). In addition, we compete with numerous specialized applications providers focused in specific vertical industries, such as financial services, retail and telecommunications. SAP is a major competitor in every industry vertical. Specialized industry vertical solutions such as retail and banking are also influenced heavily by the presence of customized solutions and in-house development. 

&#160;

With SOA, our packaged applications also compete with custom solutions either developed in-house or by large systems integrators such as Accenture Ltd. or IBM Global Services. Our pre-packaged applications also compete against business process outsourcers including ADP, Fidelity Investments, Ceridian Corporation, Hewitt-Cyborg Limited and others. Our application products are architected around a single database model, which we believe is a key differentiator between our most significant competitors and us. 

&#160;

In the sale of operating systems, we introduced a support and service offering for Red Hat&#146;s open source Linux operating system in fiscal 2007. This puts us in direct competition with Red Hat, Novell, Canonical Ltd. (Ubuntu) and others in the sale of support for the Linux operating system; with IBM, Sun, H-P and others in the sale of Unix operating systems; and with Microsoft in the sale of Windows server operating systems. 

In the sale of consulting and systems integration services, we both partner with and compete against Accenture, Electronic Data Systems Corporation, IBM Global Services, Bearing Point, Inc., CapGemini Group and many others. 

&#160;

Research and Development 

&#160;

We develop the majority of our products internally. In addition, we have acquired technology through business acquisitions. We also purchase or license intellectual property rights in certain circumstances. Internal development allows us to maintain technical control over the design and development of our products. We have a number of United States and foreign patents and pending applications that relate to various aspects of our products and technology. While we believe that our patents have value, no single patent is essential to us or to any of our principal business segments. 

&#160;

Research and development expenditures were $2.2 billion, $1.9 billion and $1.5 billion, or 12%, 13% and 13% of total revenues, in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. As a percentage of new software license revenues, research and development expenditures were 37%, 38% and 37% in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Rapid technological advances in hardware and software development, evolving standards in computer hardware and software technology, changing customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements characterize the software markets in which we compete. We plan on continuing to dedicate a significant amount of resources to research and development efforts to maintain and improve our current product offerings including our database, middleware and applications software. 

&#160;

##TABLE_START "
1A," Item 1A. Risk Factors ##TABLE_END &#160;

We operate in a rapidly changing economic and technological environment that presents numerous risks, many of which are driven by factors that we cannot control or predict. The following discussion, as well as our &#147;Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates&#148; discussion in Item 7, highlights some of these risks. 

&#160;

Economic, political and market conditions can adversely affect our revenue growth and profitability. Our business is influenced by a range of factors that are beyond our control and that we have no comparative advantage in forecasting. These include: 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; general economic and business conditions; &#160; &#160; &#149; the overall demand for enterprise software and services; &#160; &#160; &#149; governmental budgetary constraints or shifts in government spending priorities; and &#160; &#160; &#149; general political developments. ##TABLE_END &#160;

A general weakening of the global economy, or a curtailment in government or corporate spending, could delay and decrease customer purchases. In addition, the war on terrorism, the war in Iraq and the potential for other hostilities in various parts of the world, potential public health crises, as well as natural disasters, continue to contribute to a climate of economic and political uncertainty that could adversely affect our revenue growth and results of operations. These factors generally have the strongest effect on our sales of software licenses, and to a lesser extent, also affect our renewal rates for software license updates and product support. 

&#160;

We may fail to achieve our financial forecasts due to inaccurate sales forecasts or other factors. Our revenues, and particularly our new software license revenues, are difficult to forecast, and as a result our quarterly operating results can fluctuate substantially. We use a &#147;pipeline&#148; system, a common industry practice, to forecast sales and trends in our business. Our sales personnel monitor the status of all proposals and estimate when a customer will make a purchase decision and the dollar amount of the sale. These estimates are aggregated periodically to generate a sales pipeline. Our pipeline estimates can prove to be unreliable both in a particular quarter and over a longer period of time, in part because the &#147;conversion rate&#148; of the pipeline into contracts can be very difficult to estimate. A contraction in the conversion rate, or in the pipeline itself, could cause us to plan or budget incorrectly and adversely affect our business or results of operations. In particular, a slowdown in information technology spending or economic conditions generally can reduce the conversion rate in particular periods as purchasing decisions are delayed, reduced in amount or cancelled. The conversion rate can also be affected by the tendency of some of our customers to wait until the end of a fiscal period in the hope of obtaining more favorable terms, which can also impede our ability to negotiate and execute these contracts in a timely manner. In addition, for newly acquired companies, we have limited ability to predict how their pipelines will convert into sales or revenues for one or two quarters following the acquisition and their conversion rate post-acquisition may be quite different from their historical conversion rate. Because a substantial portion of our new software license revenue contracts is completed in the latter part of a quarter, and our cost structure is largely fixed in the short term, revenue shortfalls tend to have a disproportionately negative impact on our profitability. A delay in even a small number of large new software license transactions could cause our quarterly new software licenses revenues to fall significantly short of our predictions. 

&#160;

Our success depends upon our ability to develop new products and services, integrate acquired products and services and enhance our existing products and services. Rapid technological advances and evolving standards in computer hardware, software development and communications infrastructure, changing and increasingly sophisticated customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements characterize the enterprise software market in which we compete. If we are unable to develop new products and services, or to enhance and improve our products and support services in a timely manner or to position and/or price our products and services to meet market demand, customers may not buy new software licenses or renew software license updates and product support. In addition, information technology standards from both consortia and formal standards-setting forums as well as de facto marketplace standards are rapidly evolving. We cannot provide any assurance that the standards on which we choose to develop new products will allow us to compete effectively for business opportunities in emerging areas. 

We are developing a next generation applications platform that is planned to combine the best features, flows and usability traits of our legacy and acquired applications. We have also announced that we intend to extend the life of many of our acquired applications and will continue to provide long-term support for our acquired products, both of which require us to dedicate resources. If we do not develop and release these new or enhanced products and services within the anticipated time frames, if there is a delay in market acceptance of a new, enhanced or acquired product line or service, if we do not timely optimize complementary product lines and services or if we fail to adequately integrate, support or enhance acquired application lines or services, our business may be adversely affected. 

&#160;

Acquisitions present many risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of any transaction. In the past three fiscal years, we have invested over $25 billion, in the aggregate, to acquire a number of companies, products, services and technologies. An active acquisition program is an important element of our overall corporate strategy and we expect to continue to make similar acquisitions in the future. Risks we may face in connection with our acquisition program include: 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; our ongoing business may be disrupted and our management&#146;s attention may be diverted by acquisition, transition or integration activities; &#160; &#160; &#149; an acquisition may not further our business strategy as we expected, or we may pay more than the acquired company or assets are worth; &#160; &#160; &#149; our due diligence process may fail to identify all of the problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired company or technology, including issues with the company&#146;s intellectual property, product quality or product architecture, revenue recognition or other accounting practices or employee, customer or partner issues; &#160; &#160; &#149; we may not realize the anticipated increase in our revenues if a larger than predicted number of customers decline to renew software license updates and product support, if we are unable to sell the acquired products to our customer base or if contract models of an acquired company do not allow us to recognize revenues on a timely basis; &#160; &#160; &#149; we may assume pre-existing contractual relationships of acquired companies that we would not have otherwise entered into, and exiting or modifying such relationships may be costly to us or disruptive to customers; &#160; &#160; &#149; we may face litigation or other claims in connection with, or may inherit claims or litigation risk as a result of, an acquisition, including claims from terminated employees, customers or other third parties; &#160; &#160; &#149; our relationship with current and new employees, customers, partners and distributors could be impaired; &#160; &#160; &#149; we may have difficulty incorporating acquired technologies or products with our existing product lines and maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies; &#160; &#160; &#149; we may have multiple and overlapping product lines as a result of our acquisitions that are offered, priced and supported differently, which could cause customer confusion and delays; &#160; &#160; &#149; we may have higher than anticipated costs in continuing support and development of acquired products; &#160; &#160; &#149; we may assume pre-existing liabilities, whether known or unknown, of acquired companies which could be material; &#160; &#160; &#149; we may be unable to obtain required approvals from governmental authorities under competition and antitrust laws on a timely basis, if it all, which could, among other things, prevent us from completing a transaction; &#160; &#160; &#149; we may have to delay or not proceed with a substantial acquisition if we cannot obtain the necessary funding to complete the acquisition in a timely manner; &#160; &#160; &#149; our use of cash to pay for acquisitions may limit other potential uses of our cash, including stock repurchases and retirement of outstanding indebtedness; ##TABLE_END 14 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; we may significantly increase our interest expense, leverage and debt service requirements if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition; result of unforeseen difficulties in our integration activities; &#160; &#160; &#149; we may have legal and tax exposures or lose anticipated tax benefits as a result of unforeseen difficulties in our integration activities; &#160; &#160; &#149; we may be unable to obtain timely approvals from, or may otherwise have certain limitations, restrictions, penalties or other sanctions imposed on us by, worker councils or similar bodies under applicable employment laws as a result of an acquisition, which could adversely affect our integration plans in certain jurisdictions; and &#160; &#160; &#149; to the extent that we issue a significant amount of equity securities in connection with future acquisitions, existing stockholders may be diluted and earnings per share may decrease. ##TABLE_END &#160;

The occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows, particularly in the case of a larger acquisition or several concurrent acquisitions. 

&#160;

We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights. We rely on copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, controls and contractual commitments to protect our intellectual property rights. Despite our efforts, these protections may be limited. Unauthorized third parties may try to copy or reverse engineer portions of our products or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property. Any patents owned by us may be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. Any of our pending or future patent applications, whether or not being currently challenged, may not be issued with the scope of the claims we seek, if at all. In addition, the laws of some countries do not provide the same level of protection of our intellectual property rights as do the laws and courts of the United States. If we cannot protect our intellectual property rights against unauthorized copying or use, or other misappropriation, we may not remain competitive. 

&#160;

Third parties may claim infringement or misuse of intellectual property rights and/ or breach of license agreement provisions. We periodically receive notices from others claiming infringement, or other misuse of their intellectual property rights and/or breach of our agreements with them. We expect the number of such claims will increase as the number of products and competitors in our industry segments grows, the functionality of products overlap, the use and support of third-party code (including open source code) becomes more prevalent in the software industry, and the volume of issued software patents continues to increase. Responding to any such claim, regardless of its validity, could: 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; be time-consuming, costly and/or result in litigation; &#160; &#160; &#149; divert management&#146;s time and attention from developing our business; &#160; &#160; &#149; require us to pay monetary damages or enter into royalty and licensing agreements that we would not normally find acceptable; &#160; &#160; &#149; require us to stop selling or to redesign certain of our products; &#160; &#160; &#149; require us to release source code to third parties, possibly under open source license terms; &#160; &#160; &#149; require us to satisfy indemnification obligations to our customers; or &#160; &#160; &#149; otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. ##TABLE_END &#160;

A patent infringement case is discussed under Note 21 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

&#160;

We may need to change our pricing models to compete successfully. The intensely competitive markets in which we compete can put pressure on us to reduce our prices. If our competitors offer deep discounts on certain products or services, we may need to lower prices or offer other favorable terms in order to compete successfully. Any such changes would likely reduce margins and could adversely affect operating results. Our software license updates and product support fees are generally priced as a percentage of our new license fees. Our competitors may offer a lower percentage pricing on product updates and support, which could put pressure on us to further discount our new license prices. Any broad-based change to our prices and pricing policies could cause new software license and services revenues to decline or be delayed as our sales force implements and our customers adjust to the new pricing 

policies. Some of our competitors may bundle software products for promotional purposes or as a long-term pricing strategy or provide guarantees of prices and product implementations. These practices could, over time, significantly constrain the prices that we can charge for our products. If we do not adapt our pricing models to reflect changes in customer use of our products, our new software license revenues could decrease. Additionally, increased distribution of applications through application service providers may reduce the average price for our products or adversely affect other sales of our products, reducing new software license revenues unless we can offset price reductions with volume increases or lower spending. The increase in open source software distribution may also cause us to change our pricing models. 

&#160;

We may be unable to compete effectively in a range of markets within the highly competitive software industry. Many vendors develop and market databases, internet application server products, application development tools, business applications, collaboration products and business intelligence products that compete with our offerings. In addition, several companies offer business process outsourcing (BPO) as a competitive alternative to buying software and customer interest in BPO solutions is increasing. Some of these competitors have greater financial or technical resources than we do. Our competitors that offer business applications and application server products may influence a customer&#146;s purchasing decision for the underlying database in an effort to persuade potential customers not to acquire our products. We could lose market share if our competitors introduce new competitive products, add new functionality, acquire competitive products, reduce prices or form strategic alliances with other companies. Vendors that offer BPO solutions may persuade our customers not to purchase our products. We may also face increasing competition from open source software initiatives, in which competitors may provide software and intellectual property free. Existing or new competitors could gain market share in any of our markets at our expense. 

&#160;

Our periodic sales force restructurings can be disruptive. We continue to rely heavily on our direct sales force. We have in the past restructured or made other adjustments to our sales force in response to management changes, product changes, performance issues, acquisitions and other internal and external considerations. In the past, sales force restructurings have generally resulted in a temporary lack of focus and reduced productivity; these effects could recur in connection with future acquisitions and other restructurings and our revenues could be negatively affected. 

&#160;

Disruptions of our indirect sales channel could affect our future operating results. Our indirect channel network is comprised primarily of resellers, system integrators/implementers, consultants, education providers, internet service providers, network integrators and independent software vendors. Our relationships with these channel participants are important elements of our marketing and sales efforts. Our financial results could be adversely affected if our contracts with channel participants were terminated, if our relationships with channel participants were to deteriorate, if any of our competitors enter into strategic relationships with or acquire a significant channel participant or if the financial condition of our channel participants were to weaken. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in maintaining, expanding or developing our relationships with channel participants. If we are not successful, we may lose sales opportunities, customers and market share. 

&#160;

Charges to earnings resulting from past acquisitions may adversely affect our operating results. Under purchase accounting, we allocate the total purchase price to an acquired company&#146;s net tangible assets, intangible assets and in-process research and development based on their fair values as of the date of the acquisition and record the excess of the purchase price over those fair values as goodwill. Management&#146;s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain. Going forward, the following factors could result in material charges that would adversely affect our results: 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; impairment of goodwill or intangible assets; &#160; &#160; &#149; identification of assumed contingent liabilities subsequent to the finalization of the purchase price allocation; and &#160; &#160; &#149; charges to income to eliminate certain Oracle pre-merger activities that duplicate those of the acquired company or to reduce our cost structure. ##TABLE_END &#160;

Charges to earnings associated with acquisitions include amortization of intangible assets, in-process research and development as well as other acquisition related charges, restructuring and stock-based compensation associated 

with assumed stock awards. Charges to earnings in any given period could differ substantially from other periods based on the timing and size of our future acquisitions and the extent of integration activities. See Item 7, &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#151;Supplemental Disclosure Related to Acquisition Accounting and Stock-Based Compensation&#148; for additional information about charges to earnings associated with our recent acquisitions. 

&#160;

We expect to continue to incur additional costs associated with combining the operations of our previously acquired companies, which may be substantial. Additional costs may include costs of employee redeployment, relocation and retention, including salary increases or bonuses, accelerated amortization of deferred equity compensation and severance payments, reorganization or closure of facilities, taxes and termination of contracts that provide redundant or conflicting services. Some of these costs may have to be accounted for as expenses that would decrease our net income and earnings per share for the periods in which those adjustments are made. 

&#160;

Our international sales and operations subject us to additional risks that can adversely affect our operating results. We derive a substantial portion of our revenues, and have significant operations, outside of the United States. Our international operations include software development, sales, customer support and shared administrative service centers. We are subject to a variety of risks, including those related to general economic conditions in each country or region, regulatory changes, political unrest, terrorism and the potential for other hostilities and public health risks, particularly in areas in which we have significant operations. We face challenges in managing an organization operating in various countries, which can entail longer payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable, overlapping tax regimes, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, difficulties in transferring funds from certain countries and reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries. We must comply with a variety of international laws and regulations, including trade restrictions, local labor ordinances, changes in tariff rates and import and export licensing requirements. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these difficulties. 

&#160;

We are a majority shareholder of i-flex solutions limited, a publicly traded Indian software company focused on the banking industry. As the majority shareholder of an international entity, we are faced with several additional risks, including being subject to local securities regulations and being unable to exert full control or obtain financial and other information on a timely basis. 

&#160;

We may experience foreign currency gains and losses. We conduct a portion of our business in currencies other than the United States dollar. Our revenues and operating results are adversely affected when the dollar strengthens relative to other currencies and are positively affected when the dollar weakens. Changes in the value of major foreign currencies, particularly the Euro, Japanese Yen and British Pound relative to the United States dollar can significantly affect revenues and our operating results. 

&#160;

Our foreign currency transaction gains and losses, primarily related to sublicense fees and other agreements among us and our subsidiaries and distributors, are charged against earnings in the period incurred. We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain transaction and translation exposures in major currencies, but we will continue to experience foreign currency gains and losses in certain instances where it is not possible or cost effective to hedge foreign currencies. 

&#160;

Oracle On Demand and CRM On Demand may not be successful. We offer Oracle On Demand outsourcing services for our applications and database technology, delivered either at our data center facilities or at a site of our customer&#146;s choosing. We also offer CRM On Demand, which is a service offering that provides our customers with our Siebel CRM software functionality delivered via a hosted solution that we manage. These business models continue to evolve and we may not be able to compete effectively, generate significant revenues or develop them into profitable businesses. We incur expenses associated with the infrastructures and marketing of our Oracle On Demand and CRM On Demand businesses in advance of our ability to recognize the revenues associated with our subscription-based contracts. These businesses are subject to a variety of risks including: 

&#160;

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; we manage critical customer applications, data and other confidential information through Oracle On Demand and CRM On Demand; accordingly, we face increased exposure to significant damage claims and risk to future business prospects in the event of system failures or inadequate disaster recovery or misappropriation of customer confidential information; &#160; &#160; &#149; we may face regulatory exposure in certain areas such as data privacy, data security and export compliance, as well as workforce reduction claims as a result of customers transferring their information technology functions to us; &#160; &#160; &#149; the laws and regulations applicable to hosted service providers are unsettled, particularly in the areas of privacy and security and use of offshore resources; changes in these laws could affect our ability to provide services from or to some locations and could increase both the costs and risks associated with providing the services; &#160; &#160; &#149; demand for these services may be affected by customer and media concerns about security risks and/or use of outsourced services providers more generally; and &#160; &#160; &#149; our offerings may require large fixed costs such as for data centers, computers, network infrastructure and security and we may not be able to generate sufficient revenues to offset these costs and generate acceptable operating margins from these offerings. ##TABLE_END &#160;

We may be unable to hire enough qualified employees or we may lose key employees. We rely on the continued service of our senior management, including our Chief Executive Officer, members of our executive team and other key employees and the hiring of new qualified employees. In the software industry, there is substantial and continuous competition for highly skilled business, product development, technical and other personnel. In addition, acquisitions could cause us to lose key personnel of the acquired companies or at Oracle. We may experience increased compensation costs that are not offset by either improved productivity or higher prices. We may not be successful in recruiting new personnel and in retaining and motivating existing personnel. With rare exceptions, we do not have long-term employment or non-competition agreements with our employees. Members of our senior management team have left Oracle over the years for a variety of reasons, and we cannot assure you that there will not be additional departures, which may be disruptive to our operations. 

&#160;

We continually focus on improving our cost structure by hiring personnel in countries where advanced technical expertise is available at lower costs. When we make adjustments to our workforce, we may incur expenses associated with workforce reductions that delay the benefit of a more efficient workforce structure. We may also experience increased competition for employees in these countries as the trend toward globalization continues which may affect our employee retention efforts and/or increase our expenses in an effort to offer a competitive compensation program. 

&#160;

Part of our total compensation program includes stock options. Stock options are an important tool in attracting and retaining employees in our industry. If our stock price performs poorly it may adversely affect our ability to retain or attract employees. In addition, because we now expense all stock-based compensation, we may in the future change our stock-based and other compensation practices. Some of the changes we are considering include the reduction in the number of employees granted options, a reduction in the number of options granted and a change to alternative forms of stock-based compensation. Any changes in our compensation practices or changes made by competitors could affect our ability to retain and motivate existing personnel and recruit new personnel. 

&#160;

We might experience significant errors or security flaws in our products and services. Despite testing prior to their release, software products frequently contain errors or security flaws, especially when first introduced or when new versions are released. The detection and correction of any security flaws can be time consuming and costly. Errors in our software products could affect the ability of our products to work with other hardware or software products, could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products and could adversely affect market acceptance of our products. If we experience errors or delays in releasing new products or new versions of products, we could lose revenues. In addition, we run our own business operations, Oracle On Demand, and other outsourcing, support and consulting services, on our products and networks and any security flaws, if exploited, could affect our ability to conduct business operations. End users, who rely on our products and services for applications that are critical to their businesses, may have a greater sensitivity to product errors and security 

vulnerabilities than customers for software products generally. Software product errors and security flaws in our products or services could expose us to product liability, performance and/or warranty claims as well as harm our reputation, which could impact our future sales of products and services. In addition, we may be legally required to publicly report security breaches of our services, which could adversely impact future business prospects for those services. 

&#160;

We may not receive significant revenues from our current research and development efforts for several years, if at all. Developing and localizing software is expensive and the investment in product development often involves a long payback cycle. We have made and expect to continue to make significant investments in software research and development and related product opportunities. Accelerated product introductions and short product life cycles require high levels of expenditures for research and development that could adversely affect our operating results if not offset by revenue increases. We believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position. However, we do not expect to receive significant revenues from these investments for several years if at all. 

&#160;

Our sales to government clients subject us to risks including early termination, audits, investigations, sanctions and penalties. We derive revenues from contracts with the United States government, state and local governments and their respective agencies, which may terminate most of these contracts at any time, without cause. 

&#160;

There is increased pressure for governments and their agencies, both domestically and internationally, to reduce spending. Our federal government contracts are subject to the approval of appropriations being made by the United States Congress to fund the expenditures under these contracts. Similarly, our contracts at the state and local levels are subject to government funding authorizations. 

&#160;

Additionally, government contracts are generally subject to audits and investigations which could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, refund of a portion of fees received, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business. 

&#160;

Business disruptions could affect our operating results. A significant portion of our research and development activities and certain other critical business operations is concentrated in a few geographic areas. We are a highly automated business and a disruption or failure of our systems could cause delays in completing sales and providing services, including some of our On Demand offerings. A major earthquake, fire or other catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and as a result our future operating results could be materially and adversely affected. 

&#160;

Adverse litigation results could affect our business. We are subject to various legal proceedings. Litigation can be lengthy, expensive, and disruptive to our operations and results cannot be predicted with certainty. An adverse decision could result in monetary damages or injunctive relief that could affect our business, operating results or financial condition. Additional information regarding certain of the lawsuits we are involved in is discussed under Note 21 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

&#160;

PeopleSoft&#146;s Customer Assurance Program may expose us to substantial liabilities if triggered. In June 2003, in response to our tender offer, PeopleSoft implemented what it referred to as the &#147;customer assurance program&#148; or &#147;CAP&#148;. The CAP incorporated a provision in PeopleSoft&#146;s standard licensing arrangement that purports to contractually burden Oracle, as a result of its acquisition of PeopleSoft, with a contingent obligation to make payments to PeopleSoft customers should Oracle fail to take certain business actions for a fixed period of time subsequent to the acquisition. The payment obligation, which typically expires four years from the date of the contract, is fixed at an amount generally between two and five times the license and first year support fees paid to PeopleSoft in the applicable license transaction. This purported obligation was not reflected as a liability on PeopleSoft&#146;s balance sheet as PeopleSoft concluded that it could be triggered only following the consummation of an acquisition. PeopleSoft used six different standard versions of the CAP over the 18-month period commencing June 2003. PeopleSoft ceased using the CAP on December 29, 2004, the date on which we acquired a controlling interest in PeopleSoft. We have concluded that, as of the date of the PeopleSoft acquisition, the penalty provisions under the CAP represented a contingent liability of Oracle. The aggregate potential CAP obligation as of May 31, 

2007 was $3.2 billion. Unless the CAP provisions are removed from these licensing arrangements, we do not expect the aggregate potential CAP obligation to decline substantially until fiscal year 2008 when a significant number of these provisions begin to expire. The last CAP obligation will expire on December 31, 2008. We have not recorded a liability related to the CAP, as we do not believe it is probable that our post-acquisition activities related to the PeopleSoft product line will trigger an obligation to make any payment pursuant to the CAP. 

&#160;

In addition, while no assurance can be given as to the ultimate outcome of litigation, we believe we would also have substantial defenses with respect to the legality and enforceability of the CAP contract provisions in response to any claims seeking payment from Oracle under the CAP terms. While we have taken extensive steps to assure customers that we intend to continue developing and supporting the PeopleSoft and JD Edwards product lines and as of May 31, 2007 we have not received any claims for CAP payments, PeopleSoft customers may assert claims for CAP payments. 

&#160;

We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities. As a multinational corporation, we are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. 

&#160;

In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many intercompany transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities. Our intercompany transfer pricing is currently being reviewed by the IRS and by foreign tax jurisdictions and will likely be subject to additional audits in the future. We previously negotiated three unilateral Advance Pricing Agreements with the IRS that cover many of our intercompany transfer pricing issues and preclude the IRS from making a transfer pricing adjustment within the scope of these agreements. However, these agreements, which are effective for fiscal years through May 31, 2006, do not cover all elements of our transfer pricing and do not bind tax authorities outside the United States. We have finalized one bilateral Advance Pricing Agreement and currently are negotiating an additional bilateral agreement to cover the period from June 1, 2001 through May 31, 2008. There can be no guarantee that such negotiations will result in an agreement. 

&#160;

Although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable, we cannot assure you that the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. 

&#160;

We are also subject to non-income taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net worth, property and goods and services taxes, in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities with respect to these non-income taxes and may have exposure to additional non-income tax liabilities. Our acquisition activities have increased our non-income tax exposures. 

&#160;

There are risks associated with our outstanding indebtedness. As of May 31, 2007, we had an aggregate of $6.3 billion of outstanding indebtedness that will mature between 2009 and 2016 and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our ability to pay interest and repay the principal for our indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations and the other factors discussed in this section. There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks successfully. In addition, changes by any rating agency to our outlook or credit rating could negatively affect the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities. 

&#160;

Our stock price could become more volatile and your investment could lose value. All of the factors discussed in this section could affect our stock price. The timing of announcements in the public market regarding new products, product enhancements or technological advances by our competitors or us, and any announcements by us of acquisitions, major transactions, or management changes could also affect our stock price. Our stock price is subject to speculation in the press and the analyst community, changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by financial analysts, changes in investors&#146; or analysts&#146; valuation measures for our stock, our credit ratings and market trends unrelated to our performance. A significant drop in our stock price could also expose us to the risk of securities class actions lawsuits, which could result in substantial costs and divert management&#146;s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business.

Interest Income Rate Risk. In the first quarter of fiscal 2007, we began designating newly acquired fixed income investments as available-for-sale. As a result of the available-for-sale designation, all securities purchased after May 31, 2006 are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value. As of May 31, 2007, substantially all investments held are classified as available-for-sale. 

&#160;

We generally purchase investments with relatively short maturities. Therefore, interest rate movements generally do not materially affect the valuation of our investments. Auction rate securities are reported on the balance sheet at par value, which equals market value, as the rate on such securities re-sets generally every 7 to 28 days. Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect our interest income that is generated from our investments. For fiscal 2007, total interest income was $295 million with investments yielding an average 3.97% on a worldwide basis. This interest rate level was up approximately 93 basis points from 3.04% for fiscal 2006. If overall interest rates fell by a similar amount (93 basis points) in fiscal 2008, our interest income would decline by approximately $70 million, assuming consistent investment levels. The table below presents the cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities balances 

and the related weighted average interest rates for our investment portfolio at May 31, 2007. The cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities balances approximate fair value at May 31, 2007:

Interest Expense Rate Risk. Borrowings as of May 31, 2007 were $7.6 billion, consisting of $5.6 billion of fixed rate borrowings and $2.0 billion of variable rate borrowings. Our variable rate borrowings were as follows at May 31, 2007:

Interest expense for fiscal 2007 was $343 million. Based on effective interest rates at May 31, 2007, a 50 basis point increase in interest rates on our borrowings subject to variable interest rate fluctuations would increase our interest expense by approximately $17 million annually. 

&#160;

Foreign Currency Transaction Risk. We transact business in various foreign currencies and have established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risks associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures. Under this program, increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the forward contracts, to mitigate the possibility of foreign currency transaction gains or losses. These foreign currency exposures typically arise from intercompany sublicense fees and other intercompany transactions. Our forward contracts generally have terms of 90 days or less. We do not use forward contracts for trading purposes. All outstanding foreign currency forward contracts (excluding our Yen equity hedge described below) are marked to market at the end of the period with unrealized gains and losses included in non-operating income, net. Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to currency fluctuations will depend on the currency exchange rates and other factors in effect as the contracts mature. Net foreign exchange transaction gains 

(losses) included in non-operating income, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations were $17 million, $15 million and $(28) million in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The unrealized gains (losses) of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts were $5 million and $(0.3) million at May 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 

&#160;

The tables below present the notional amounts (at contract exchange rates) and the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates for the outstanding forward contracts as of May 31, 2007. Notional weighted average exchange rates listed in the tables below are quoted using market conventions. All of our forward contracts mature within one year with the substantial majority maturing within 90 days or less as of May 31, 2007.

Net Investment Risk. Periodically, we hedge the net assets of certain international subsidiaries (net investment hedges) using foreign currency forward contracts to offset the translation and economic exposures related to our investments in these subsidiaries. We measure the effectiveness of net investment hedges by using the changes in spot exchange rates because this method reflects our risk management strategies, the economics of those strategies in our financial statements and better manages interest rate differentials between different countries. Under this method, the change in fair value of the forward contract attributable to the changes in spot exchange rates (the effective portion) is reported in stockholders&#146; equity to offset the translation results on the net investments. The remaining change in fair value of the forward contract (the ineffective portion) is recognized in non-operating income, net. 

&#160;

Net gains (losses) on investment hedges reported in stockholders&#146; equity prior to tax effects were $45 million, $23 million and $(23) million in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The net gain on investment hedges reported in non-operating income, net were $28 million, $24 million and $14 million in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. 

&#160;

At May 31, 2007, we had one net investment hedge in Japanese Yen. The Yen investment hedge minimizes currency risk arising from net assets held in Yen as a result of equity capital raised during the initial public offering and secondary offering of Oracle Japan. The fair value of our Yen investment hedge was $0.2 million at May 31, 2007 and 2006. As of May 31, 2007, the Yen investment hedge has a notional amount of $548 million and an exchange rate of 120.22 Yen for each United States dollar.
