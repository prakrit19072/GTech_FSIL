General 

&#160;

We are the world&#146;s largest enterprise software company. We develop, manufacture, market, distribute and service database and middleware software as well as applications software designed to help our customers manage and grow their business operations. 

&#160;

Our goal is to offer customers scalable, reliable, secure and integrated software solutions that improve transactional efficiencies, adapt to an organization&#146;s unique needs and allow better ways to access and manage information at a lower total cost of ownership. We seek to be an industry leader in each of the specific product categories in which we compete and to expand into new and emerging markets. 

&#160;

We believe our internal or organic growth and continued innovation with respect to our core database, middleware and applications technologies provide the foundation for our long-term strategic plan. In fiscal 2008, we invested $2.7 billion on research and development to enhance our existing portfolio of products and services and to develop new products, features and services. 

&#160;

An active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy. Over the last four fiscal years, we have invested billions of dollars, including $9.4 billion in fiscal 2008, to acquire a number of complementary companies, products, services and technologies such as BEA Systems, Inc. in fiscal 2008, Hyperion Solutions Corporation in fiscal 2007, Siebel Systems, Inc. in fiscal 2006 and PeopleSoft, Inc. in fiscal 2005. We believe our acquisition program supports our long-term strategic direction, strengthens our competitive position, expands our customer base, provides greater scale to accelerate innovation, grows our revenues and earnings, and increases stockholder value. We expect to continue to acquire companies, products, services and technologies. 

&#160;

Oracle Corporation was incorporated in 2005 as a Delaware corporation and is the successor to operations originally begun in June 1977. 

&#160;

Software and Services 

&#160;

We are organized into two businesses, software and services, which are further divided into five operating segments. Our software business is comprised of two operating segments: (1) new software licenses and (2) software license updates and product support. Our services business is comprised of three operating segments: (1) consulting, (2) On Demand and (3) education. Our software and services businesses represented 80% and 20% of our total revenues, respectively, in both fiscal 2008 and 2006, and 79% and 21% of our total revenues, respectively, in fiscal 2007. See Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our operating segments. 

Software Business 

&#160;

New Software Licenses 

&#160;

New software licenses include the licensing of database and middleware software, which consists of Oracle Databases and Oracle Fusion Middleware, as well as applications software. Our technology and business solutions are based on an internet model comprised of interconnected databases, application servers, as well as mobile devices. This architecture enables users to access business data and applications through a web browser interface, while providing customers the most efficient and cost effective method of managing business information and applications. 

&#160;

In an internet model, database servers manage and protect the underlying business information, while application servers run the business applications that automate a myriad of business functions. We have focused on concepts such as global single instance application deployment that involve fewer, high quality databases of important business information. Our architecture provides high quality business information and can be adapted to the specific needs of any industry or application. Oracle technology operates on both single server and clustered server configurations, which we refer to as &#147;grid&#148; software, and supports a choice of operating systems including Linux, Windows and UNIX. 

&#160;

New software license revenues include fees earned from granting customers licenses to use our software products and exclude revenues derived from software license updates and product support. The standard end user software license agreement for our products provides for an initial fee to use the product in perpetuity based on a maximum number of processors, named users or other metrics. We also have other types of software license agreements restricted by the number of employees or the license term. New software license revenues represented 34%, 33% and 34% of total revenues in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 

&#160;

Database and Middleware Software 

&#160;

Our database and middleware software provides a cost-effective, high-performance platform for running and managing business applications for mid-size businesses and large global enterprises. With an increasing focus by enterprises on reducing their total cost of information technology (IT) infrastructure, our software is designed to accommodate demanding, non-stop business environments, using clusters of low cost servers and storage that can incrementally scale as required. The ability to assign computing resources as required simplifies our customers&#146; computing capacity, planning and procurement in order to support all of their business applications. With an Oracle grid infrastructure, our customers can lower their investment in IT hardware, reduce their risk of IT infrastructure downtime and more easily cope with sudden increases in demand on their IT environments during high traffic periods. New software license revenues from database and middleware products represented 68%, 71% and 73% of our new software license revenues in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 

&#160;

Databases 

&#160;

As the world&#146;s most popular database, Oracle Database enables the secure storage, retrieval and manipulation of all forms of data, including business application and analytics data, and unstructured data in the form of XML files, office documents, images, video and spatial data. Designed for enterprise grid computing, the Oracle Database is available in four editions: Express Edition, Standard Edition One, Standard Edition and Enterprise Edition. All editions are built using the same underlying code, which means that our database software can easily scale from small, single processor servers to clusters of multi-processor servers. 

&#160;

Options to Oracle Database Enterprise Edition are available to meet specific requirements in the areas of performance and scalability, high availability, data security and compliance, data warehousing, unstructured data integration and systems management. Examples of these options include: 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; Oracle Real Application Clusters, which consolidates a single, scalable and fault tolerant database that is shared across interconnected clusters of servers; &#160; &#160; &#149; Oracle Partitioning, which breaks down large transaction processing and business intelligence database tables into smaller segments for faster query performance and easier management of data throughout its lifecycle; ##TABLE_END 2 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; Oracle Warehouse Builder Enterprise and Data Quality Options, which help customers design, build and populate data warehouses with reliable, quality information from a variety of legacy repositories; and &#160; &#160; &#149; Oracle In-Memory Database Cache, a new option that improves application performance by caching or storing performance critical parts of Oracle Database in the main memory of the application tier. ##TABLE_END &#160;

In addition to the four editions of Oracle Database, Oracle also offers a selection of specialized databases: 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; Oracle TimesTen In-Memory Database, which is a memory-optimized relational database that delivers low latency and high throughput for applications requiring real-time performance; &#160; &#160; &#149; Oracle Berkeley DB, which is a family of open source, embeddable, non-relational databases that allows developers to incorporate a fast, scalable and reliable database engine within their applications; and &#160; &#160; &#149; Oracle Database Lite, which is a comprehensive solution for developing, deploying and managing applications for mobile and embedded environments. It consists of a small footprint relational database that runs on many devices and platforms, a mobile server that synchronizes data between the mobile devices and Oracle Database, and mobile application development tools. ##TABLE_END &#160;

&#160;

International Markets 

&#160;

We sell our products and provide services globally. Our geographic coverage allows us to draw on business and technical expertise from a global workforce, provides stability to our operations and revenue streams to offset geography-specific economic trends and offers us an opportunity to take advantage of new markets for our products. A summary of our domestic and international revenues and long-lived assets is set forth in Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

&#160;

Seasonality and Cyclicality 

&#160;

Our quarterly results reflect distinct seasonality in the sale of our products and services, as our revenues are typically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter and lowest in our first fiscal quarter. General economic conditions also have an impact on our business and financial results. The markets in which we sell our products and services have, at times, experienced weak economic conditions that have negatively affected our revenues. See &#147;Selected Quarterly Financial Data&#148; in Item 7 of this Annual Report for a more complete description of the seasonality and cyclicality of our revenues and expenses. 

&#160;

Customers 

&#160;

Our customer base consists of a significant number of businesses of many sizes and industries, government agencies, educational institutions and resellers. No single customer accounted for 10% or more of revenues in fiscal 2008, 2007 or 2006. 

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The enterprise software industry is highly fragmented, intensely competitive and evolving rapidly. We compete in various segments of this industry including, but not limited to: 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; database software; &#160; &#160; &#149; middleware (including application server, business intelligence, application integration, content management, portal server and identity management); &#160; &#160; &#149; collaboration; &#160; &#160; &#149; development tools; &#160; &#160; &#149; enterprise applications; &#160; &#160; &#149; software as a service; &#160; &#160; &#149; hosted and On Demand solutions; &#160; &#160; &#149; operating systems; &#160; &#160; &#149; virtualization software; and &#160; &#160; &#149; consulting/systems integration. ##TABLE_END &#160;

Total cost of ownership, performance, scalability, functionality, ease of use, open standards-compliance, product reliability, Service-Oriented Architecture, security and quality of technical support are key competitive factors in each of the areas in which we compete. Our customers are also demanding less complexity and lower cost in the implementation, sourcing, integration and ongoing maintenance of their enterprise software, which has led increasingly to our product offerings (database, middleware and applications) being viewed as a &#147;stack&#148; of software designed to work together. 

Our product sales (and the relative strength of our products versus our competitors&#146; products) are also affected by the broader &#147;platform&#148; competition between industry standard Java (J2EE) by Sun Microsystems, Inc. (Sun Microsystems) and Microsoft Corporation&#146;s .NET programming environments and by operating system competition among Microsoft&#146;s Windows Server, Unix (Sun Microsystem&#146;s Solaris, Hewlett Packard Company&#146;s (HP)-UX and International Business Machines Corporation&#146;s (IBM)-AIX) and Linux. Open source alternatives to commercial software are also impacting the competitive environment. These products are typically offered free of charge and are readily available over the internet. Finally, software-as-a-service (SaaS) offerings continue to alter the competitive landscape. 

&#160;

The following lists of competitors are necessarily incomplete due to the nature of the enterprise software industry. The competitive landscape is constantly evolving as firms emerge, expand, are acquired and otherwise change. 

&#160;

In the sale of database software, scalability, reliability, availability and security are key competitive differentiators for us. Our competitors include IBM, Microsoft, Sybase, Inc., NCR Corporation&#146;s Teradata division, SAS Institute, Inc., Informatica Corporation, and the open source databases such as MySQL (recently acquired by Sun Microsystems) and PostgreSQL, among others. Our ability to continually innovate and differentiate our database product offerings has enabled us to maintain our leading position in database software over our competitors. 

&#160;

In the sale of middleware products, our offerings include application server, business intelligence, application integration, business process management, Service-Oriented Architecture, collaboration and content management, portal, and identity management software. Our ability to offer a full range of rich functionality in a standards-based, open architecture has been a key competitive differentiator. Our competitors include IBM, Microsoft, SAP AG, Sun Microsystems, Progress Software, Fujitsu Software Corporation, Hitachi Software Engineering Co., Ltd., open source vendors such as Red Hat, Inc. (JBoss), Apache Geronimo, and Netezza Corporation, as well as several other competitors in each element of our packaged functions such as TIBCO Software, Inc., Software AG, Savvion, Inc., Microstrategy, Inc., CA, Inc., Informatica, Novell, Inc., Lombardi Software, Inc. and Pegasystems, Inc., among others. Our middleware solutions have experienced rapid growth in recent years relative to our competitors. 

&#160;

In the sale of collaboration and content management products, we compete with Microsoft, IBM (Domino/Notes/FileNet), EMC Corporation (Documentum), Open Text Corporation, Interwoven, Inc., HP (Tower Software) and Vignette Corporation, among others. 

&#160;

In the sale of development tools, ease of use, standards-compliance and the level of abstraction (automated code generation) are key competitive differentiators. We compete against IBM (WebSphere Studio), Microsoft (VisualStudio.NET), Sun Microsystems (Sun Studio), Sybase (PowerBuilder) and others, including Eclipse Foundation, Inc. (Eclipse), an open source vendor. The success of our development tools is closely related to the relative popularity of our platform (database and middleware) compared to our competitors as well as the larger competition between Java and Microsoft&#146;s .NET. 

&#160;

The sale of applications software, in particular, is changing rapidly due to the development and deployment of Service-Oriented Architectures and web services, application integration middleware as well as software as a service offerings. As a result of our acquisitions of PeopleSoft and Siebel, we currently offer several product lines that are suited for different needs of customers in different industries. One of the main competitive differentiators in applications software is our ability to combine best-of-breed software, Suite software and our Application Integration Architecture, while shielding the end user from complexities. We compete against SAP AG, Lawson Software, Inc., Infor Global Solutions GmbH (SSA Global Technologies, Extensity), Microsoft Dynamics (Dynamics GP, Dynamics NAV, Dynamics CRM, Dynamics Snap, Dynamics SL), Sage, Inc., and IBM (Maximo, MOR Software, Ascential Software) as well as many other application providers and point solution providers. 

&#160;

We also provide applications specific to operations in particular industry verticals, such as retailing, financial services, communications, tax and utilities, health sciences, public sector and others. These applications are distinguished from enterprise resource planning (ERP) or customer relationship management (CRM) in that these industry-specific applications are focused on and limited to particular industry segments, as opposed to being designed for broad distribution across several industries. We typically compete with commercial software vendors&#146; pre-packaged applications, applications developed in-house by customers, applications which were custom developed by other software vendors and applications consisting of discrete pieces of functionality from multiple 

providers which have been customized and implemented by systems integrators. In some of these industries, complete industry solutions either do not exist or are addressed by dozens of software participants. 

&#160;

With service-oriented architecture, our packaged applications also compete with custom solutions developed either in-house or by large systems integrators such as Accenture Ltd. or IBM Global Services. 

&#160;

Our applications also compete against business process outsourcers including Automatic Data Processing, Inc., Fidelity Investments, Ceridian Corporation, Hewitt-Cyborg Limited and others. 

&#160;

In the sale of operating systems, we introduced a support and service offering for Red Hat&#146;s open source Linux operating system in fiscal 2007. This placed us in competition with others who offer support for the Linux operating system, including Red Hat, Novell and Canonical Ltd. (Ubuntu); with IBM, Sun Microsystems, HP and others in the sale of Unix operating systems; and with Microsoft in the sale of Windows Server operating systems. 

&#160;

In the sale of virtualization products, we compete with VMware, Inc., IBM, Microsoft, Sun Microsystems and Citrix Systems, Inc., among others, including other vendors of open source virtualization products. 

&#160;

In the sale of consulting and systems integration services, we both partner with and compete against Accenture, Electronic Data Systems Corporation (to be acquired by HP), IBM Global Services, Bearing Point, Inc., CapGemini Group, and many others (both large and small). 

&#160;

In the sale of many of our products, we also compete with products and features developed internally by customers and their IT staff. 

&#160;

Research and Development 

&#160;

We develop the substantial majority of our products internally. In addition, we have acquired technology through business acquisitions. We also purchase or license intellectual property rights in certain circumstances. Internal development allows us to maintain technical control over the design and development of our products. We have a number of United States and foreign patents and pending applications that relate to various aspects of our products and technology. While we believe that our patents have value, no single patent is essential to us or to any of our principal business segments. 

&#160;

Research and development expenditures were $2.7 billion, $2.2 billion and $1.9 billion, or 12%, 12% and 13% of total revenues, in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. As a percentage of new software license revenues, research and development expenditures were 36%, 37% and 38% in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Rapid technological advances in hardware and software development, evolving standards in computer hardware and software technology, changing customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements characterize the software markets in which we compete. We plan on continuing to dedicate a significant amount of resources to research and development efforts to maintain and improve our current product offerings including our database, middleware and applications software products. 

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

As of May 31, 2008, we employed 84,233 full-time employees, including 19,465 in sales and marketing, 7,642 in software license updates and product support, 28,215 in services, 20,607 in research and development and 8,304 in general and administrative positions. Of these employees, 28,079 were located in the United States and 56,154 were employed internationally. None of our employees in the United States is represented by a labor union; however, in certain international subsidiaries workers&#146; councils represent our employees.

##TABLE_START "
1A," Item 1A. Risk Factors ##TABLE_END &#160;

We operate in a rapidly changing economic and technological environment that presents numerous risks, many of which are driven by factors that we cannot control or predict. The following discussion, as well as our &#147;Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates&#148; discussion in Item 7, highlights some of these risks. 

&#160;

Economic, political and market conditions can adversely affect our revenue growth and profitability. Our business is influenced by a range of factors that are beyond our control and that we have no comparative advantage in forecasting. These include: 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; general economic and business conditions; &#160; &#160; &#149; the overall demand for enterprise software and services; &#160; &#160; &#149; governmental budgetary constraints or shifts in government spending priorities; and &#160; &#160; &#149; general political developments. ##TABLE_END &#160;

A general weakening of, or declining corporate confidence in, the global economy, or a curtailment in government or corporate spending could delay or decrease customer purchases. In addition, the war on terrorism, the war in Iraq and the potential for other hostilities in various parts of the world, potential public health crises and natural disasters continue to contribute to a climate of economic and political uncertainty that could adversely affect our revenue growth and results of operations. These factors generally have the strongest effect on our sales of software licenses and related services and, to a lesser extent, also affect our renewal rates for software license updates and product support. 

&#160;

We may fail to achieve our financial forecasts due to inaccurate sales forecasts or other factors. Our revenues, and particularly our new software license revenues, are difficult to forecast, and, as a result, our quarterly operating results can fluctuate substantially. We use a &#147;pipeline&#148; system, a common industry practice, to forecast sales and trends in our business. Our sales personnel monitor the status of all proposals and estimate when a customer will make a purchase decision and the dollar amount of the sale. These estimates are aggregated periodically to generate a sales pipeline. Our pipeline estimates can prove to be unreliable both in a particular quarter and over a longer period of time, in part because the &#147;conversion rate&#148; of the pipeline into contracts can be very difficult to estimate. A contraction in the conversion rate, or in the pipeline itself, could cause us to plan or budget incorrectly and adversely affect our business or results of operations. In particular, a slowdown in IT spending or economic conditions generally can reduce the conversion rate in particular periods as purchasing decisions are delayed, reduced in amount or cancelled. The conversion rate can also be affected by the tendency of some of our customers to wait until the end of a fiscal period in the hope of obtaining more favorable terms, which can also impede our ability to negotiate and execute these contracts in a timely manner. In addition, for newly acquired companies, we have limited ability to predict how their pipelines will convert into sales or revenues for one or two quarters following the acquisition, and their conversion rate post-acquisition may be quite different from their historical conversion rate. 

A substantial portion of our new software license revenue contracts is completed in the latter part of a quarter and a significant percentage of these are large orders. Because our cost structure is largely fixed in the short term, revenue shortfalls tend to have a disproportionately negative impact on our profitability. The number of large new software license transactions also increases the risk of fluctuation in our quarterly results because a delay in even a small number of these transactions could cause our quarterly new software licenses revenues to fall significantly short of our predictions. 

&#160;

Our success depends upon our ability to develop new products and services, integrate acquired products and services and enhance our existing products and services. Rapid technological advances and evolving standards in computer hardware, software development and communications infrastructure, changing and increasingly sophisticated customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements characterize the enterprise software market in which we compete. If we are unable to develop new products and services, or to enhance and improve our products and support services in a timely manner or to position and/or price our products and services to meet market demand, customers may not buy new software licenses or renew software license updates and product support. In addition, IT standards from both consortia and formal standards-setting forums as well as de facto marketplace standards are rapidly evolving. We cannot provide any assurance that the standards on which we choose to develop new products will allow us to compete effectively for business opportunities in emerging areas. 

&#160;

We are developing a next generation applications platform called Oracle Fusion Applications that is planned to combine the best features, flows and usability traits of our existing and acquired applications. We have also announced that we intend to extend the life of many of our acquired applications and will continue to provide long-term support for our acquired products, both of which require us to dedicate resources. If we do not develop and release these new or enhanced products and services within the anticipated time frames, if there is a delay in market acceptance of a new, enhanced or acquired product line or service, if we do not timely optimize complementary product lines and services or if we fail to adequately integrate, support or enhance acquired application lines or services, our business may be adversely affected. 

&#160;

Acquisitions present many risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of any transaction. In the past four fiscal years, we have invested billions of dollars, including $9.4 billion in fiscal 2008, to acquire a number of companies, products, services and technologies. An active acquisition program is an important element of our overall corporate strategy and we expect to continue to make similar acquisitions in the future. Risks we may face in connection with our acquisition program include: 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; our ongoing business may be disrupted and our management&#146;s attention may be diverted by acquisition, transition or integration activities; &#160; &#160; &#149; an acquisition may not further our business strategy as we expected, or we may pay more than the acquired company or assets are worth; &#160; &#160; &#149; our due diligence process may fail to identify all of the problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired company or technology, including issues with the company&#146;s intellectual property, product quality or product architecture, revenue recognition or other accounting practices or employee, customer or partner issues; &#160; &#160; &#149; we may have legal and tax exposures or lose anticipated tax benefits as a result of unforeseen difficulties in our integration activities; &#160; &#160; &#149; we may not realize the anticipated increase in our revenues if a larger than predicted number of customers decline to renew software license updates and product support, if we are unable to sell the acquired products to our customer base or if contract models of an acquired company do not allow us to recognize revenues on a timely basis; &#160; &#160; &#149; we may assume pre-existing contractual relationships of acquired companies that we would not have otherwise entered into, and exiting or modifying such relationships may be costly to us or disruptive to customers; &#160; &#160; &#149; we may face litigation or other claims in connection with, or may inherit claims or litigation risk as a result of, an acquisition, including claims from terminated employees, customers, former stockholders or other third parties; ##TABLE_END 14 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; our relationship with current and new employees, customers, partners and distributors could be impaired; &#160; &#160; &#149; we may have difficulty incorporating acquired technologies or products with our existing product lines and maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies; &#160; &#160; &#149; we may have multiple and overlapping product lines as a result of our acquisitions that are offered, priced and supported differently, which could cause customer confusion and delays; &#160; &#160; &#149; we may have higher than anticipated costs in continuing support and development of acquired products; &#160; &#160; &#149; we may assume pre-existing liabilities, whether known or unknown, of acquired companies which could be material; &#160; &#160; &#149; we may be unable to obtain required approvals from governmental authorities under competition and antitrust laws on a timely basis, if it all, which could, among other things, prevent us from completing a transaction; &#160; &#160; &#149; we may have to delay or not proceed with a substantial acquisition if we cannot obtain the necessary funding to complete the acquisition in a timely manner; &#160; &#160; &#149; our use of cash to pay for acquisitions may limit other potential uses of our cash, including stock repurchases and retirement of outstanding indebtedness; &#160; &#160; &#149; we may significantly increase our interest expense, leverage and debt service requirements if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition; &#160; &#160; &#149; we may be unable to obtain timely approvals from, or may otherwise have certain limitations, restrictions, penalties or other sanctions imposed on us by, worker councils or similar bodies under applicable employment laws as a result of an acquisition, which could adversely affect our integration plans in certain jurisdictions; and &#160; &#160; &#149; to the extent that we issue a significant amount of equity securities in connection with future acquisitions, existing stockholders may be diluted and earnings per share may decrease. ##TABLE_END &#160;

The occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows, particularly in the case of a larger acquisition or several concurrent acquisitions. 

&#160;

We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights. We rely on copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, controls and contractual commitments to protect our intellectual property rights. Despite our efforts, these protections may be limited. Unauthorized third parties may try to copy or reverse engineer portions of our products or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property. Any patents owned by us may be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. Any of our pending or future patent applications, whether or not being currently challenged, may not be issued with the scope of the claims we seek, if at all. In addition, the laws of some countries do not provide the same level of protection of our intellectual property rights as do the laws and courts of the United States. If we cannot protect our intellectual property rights against unauthorized copying or use, or other misappropriation, we may not remain competitive. 

&#160;

Third parties have claimed and, in the future, may claim infringement or misuse of intellectual property rights and/or breach of license agreement provisions. We periodically receive notices from, or have lawsuits filed against us by, others claiming infringement, or other misuse of their intellectual property rights and/or breach of our agreements with them. We expect the number of such claims will increase as: 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; we continue to acquire companies; &#160; &#160; &#149; the number of products and competitors in our industry segments grows; &#160; &#160; &#149; the functionality of products overlap; &#160; &#160; &#149; the use and support of third-party code (including open source code) becomes more prevalent in the software industry; and &#160; &#160; &#149; the volume of issued software patents continues to increase. ##TABLE_END &#160;

Responding to any such claim, regardless of its validity, could: 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; be time-consuming, costly and/or result in litigation; ##TABLE_END 15 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; divert management&#146;s time and attention from developing our business; &#160; &#160; &#149; require us to pay monetary damages or enter into royalty and licensing agreements that we would not normally find acceptable; &#160; &#160; &#149; require us to stop selling or to redesign certain of our products; &#160; &#160; &#149; require us to release source code to third parties, possibly under open source license terms; &#160; &#160; &#149; require us to satisfy indemnification obligations to our customers; or &#160; &#160; &#149; otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. ##TABLE_END &#160;

Specific patent infringement cases are discussed under Note 15 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

&#160;

We may need to change our pricing models to compete successfully. The intense competition we face in the sales of our products and services and general economic and business conditions can put pressure on us to change our prices. If our competitors offer deep discounts on certain products or services, we may need to lower prices or offer other favorable terms in order to compete successfully. Any such changes may reduce margins and could adversely affect operating results. Our software license updates and product support fees are generally priced as a percentage of our net new software license fees. Our competitors may offer lower percentage pricing on product updates and support, which could put pressure on us to further discount our new license prices. 

&#160;

Any broad-based change to our prices and pricing policies could cause new software license and services revenues to decline or be delayed as our sales force implements and our customers adjust to the new pricing policies. Some of our competitors may bundle software products for promotional purposes or as a long-term pricing strategy or provide guarantees of prices and product implementations. These practices could, over time, significantly constrain the prices that we can charge for certain of our products. If we do not adapt our pricing models to reflect changes in customer use of our products or changes in customer demand, our new software license revenues could decrease. Additionally, increased distribution of applications through application service providers, including software-as-a-service (SaaS) providers, may reduce the average price for our products or adversely affect other sales of our products, reducing new software license revenues unless we can offset price reductions with volume increases or lower spending. The increase in open source software distribution may also cause us to change our pricing models. 

&#160;

We may be unable to compete effectively within the highly competitive software industry. Many vendors develop and market databases, internet application server products, application development tools, business applications, collaboration products and business intelligence products that compete with our offerings. In addition, several companies offer business process outsourcing (BPO) as a competitive alternative to buying software and customer interest in BPO solutions is increasing. Some of these competitors have greater financial or technical resources than we do. Our competitors that offer business applications and middleware products may influence a customer&#146;s purchasing decision for the underlying database in an effort to persuade potential customers not to acquire our products. We could lose customers if our competitors introduce new competitive products, add new functionality, acquire competitive products, reduce prices or form strategic alliances with other companies. Vendors that offer BPO solutions may persuade our customers not to purchase our products. We may also face increasing competition from open source software initiatives, in which competitors may provide software and intellectual property for free. Existing or new competitors could gain sales opportunities or customers at our expense. 

&#160;

Disruptions of our indirect sales channel could affect our future operating results. Our indirect channel network is comprised primarily of resellers, system integrators/implementers, consultants, education providers, internet service providers, network integrators and independent software vendors. Our relationships with these channel participants are important elements of our marketing and sales efforts. Our financial results could be adversely affected if our contracts with channel participants were terminated, if our relationships with channel participants were to deteriorate, if any of our competitors enter into strategic relationships with or acquire a significant channel participant or if the financial condition of our channel participants were to weaken. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in maintaining, expanding or developing our relationships with channel participants. If we are not successful, we may lose sales opportunities, customers and revenues. 

&#160;

Charges to earnings resulting from past acquisitions may adversely affect our operating results. Under business combination accounting standards, we allocate the total purchase price to an acquired company&#146;s net tangible assets, intangible assets and in-process research and development based on their values as of the date of the 

acquisition (including certain assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value) and record the excess of the purchase price over those values as goodwill. Management&#146;s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain. After we complete an acquisition, the following factors could result in material charges that would adversely affect our operating results and may adversely affect our cash flows:

Routine charges to our operating results associated with acquisitions include amortization of intangible assets, in-process research and development as well as other acquisition related charges, restructuring and stock-based compensation associated with assumed stock awards. Charges to our operating results in any given period could differ substantially from other periods based on the timing and size of our future acquisitions and the extent of integration activities. See Item 7. &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#151;Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges and Gains&#148; for additional information about charges to earnings associated with our recent acquisitions. 

&#160;

We expect to continue to incur additional costs associated with combining the operations of our acquired companies, which may be substantial. Additional costs may include costs of employee redeployment, relocation and retention, including salary increases or bonuses, accelerated stock-based compensation expenses and severance payments, reorganization or closure of facilities, taxes, and termination of contracts that provide redundant or conflicting services. Some of these costs may have to be accounted for as expenses that would decrease our net income and earnings per share for the periods in which those adjustments are made. 

&#160;

In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of Statement 141(R)). Statement 141(R) is effective for us beginning in fiscal 2010. We are in the process of evaluating the impact of the pending adoption of Statement 141(R) on our consolidated financial statements. We currently believe that the adoption of Statement 141(R) will result in the recognition of certain types of expenses in our results of operations that we currently capitalize pursuant to existing accounting standards and may also impact our financial statements in other ways. 

&#160;

We may be unable to hire enough qualified employees or we may lose key employees. We rely on the continued service of our senior management, including our Chief Executive Officer, members of our executive team and other key employees and the hiring of new qualified employees. In the software industry, there is substantial and continuous competition for highly skilled business, product development, technical and other personnel. In addition, acquisitions could cause us to lose key personnel of the acquired companies or at Oracle. We may also experience increased compensation costs that are not offset by either improved productivity or higher prices. We may not be successful in recruiting new personnel and in retaining and motivating existing personnel. With rare exceptions, we do not have long-term employment or non-competition agreements with our employees. Members of our senior management team have left Oracle over the years for a variety of reasons, and we cannot assure you that there will not be additional departures, which may be disruptive to our operations. 

&#160;

We continually focus on improving our cost structure by hiring personnel in countries where advanced technical expertise is available at lower costs. When we make adjustments to our workforce, we may incur expenses associated with workforce reductions that delay the benefit of a more efficient workforce structure. We may also experience increased competition for employees in these countries as the trend toward globalization continues which may affect our employee retention efforts and/or increase our expenses in an effort to offer a competitive compensation program. 

Part of our total compensation program includes stock options. Stock options are an important tool in attracting and retaining employees in our industry. If our stock price performs poorly, it may adversely affect our ability to retain or attract employees. In addition, because we expense all stock-based compensation, we may in the future change our stock-based and other compensation practices. Some of the changes we consider from time to time include the reduction in the number of employees granted options, a reduction in the number of options granted per employee and a change to alternative forms of stock-based compensation. Any changes in our compensation practices or changes made by competitors could affect our ability to retain and motivate existing personnel and recruit new personnel. 

&#160;

Our international sales and operations subject us to additional risks that can adversely affect our operating results. We derive a substantial portion of our revenues, and have significant operations, outside of the United States. Our international operations include software development, sales, customer support, consulting, On Demand and shared administrative service centers. We are subject to a variety of risks and challenges in managing an organization operating in various countries, including those related to: 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; general economic conditions in each country or region; &#160; &#160; &#149; regulatory changes; &#160; &#160; &#149; political unrest, terrorism and the potential for other hostilities; &#160; &#160; &#149; public health risks, particularly in areas in which we have significant operations; &#160; &#160; &#149; longer payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable; &#160; &#160; &#149; overlapping tax regimes; &#160; &#160; &#149; fluctuations in currency exchange rates; &#160; &#160; &#149; difficulties in transferring funds from certain countries; and &#160; &#160; &#149; reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries. ##TABLE_END &#160;

In addition, compliance with international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. These laws and regulations include data privacy requirements, labor relations laws, tax laws, anti-competition regulations, import and trade restrictions, export requirements, U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and local laws which also prohibit corrupt payments to governmental officials. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business. Any such violations could include prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries, could delay or prevent potential acquisitions, and could also materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and our operating results. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these difficulties. 

&#160;

As the majority shareholder of i-flex solutions limited, a publicly traded Indian software company focused on the banking industry, we are faced with several additional risks, including being subject to local securities regulations and being unable to exert full control or obtain financial and other information on a timely basis. 

&#160;

We may experience foreign currency gains and losses. We conduct a significant number of transactions in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Our revenues and operating results are adversely affected when the dollar strengthens relative to other currencies and are positively affected when the dollar weakens. Our revenues and operating results have recently been favorably affected by the weakening U.S. Dollar relative to other major foreign currencies. Changes in the value of major foreign currencies, particularly the Euro, Japanese Yen and British Pound relative to the U.S. Dollar can significantly affect revenues and our operating results. 

&#160;

Our foreign currency transaction gains and losses, primarily related to sublicense fees and other agreements among us and our subsidiaries and distributors, are charged against earnings in the period incurred. We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain transaction and translation exposures in major currencies, but we will continue to experience foreign currency gains and losses in certain instances where it is not possible or cost effective to hedge foreign currencies. 

Our periodic workforce restructurings can be disruptive. We have in the past restructured or made other adjustments to our workforce, including our direct sales force on which we continue to rely heavily, in response to management changes, product changes, performance issues, acquisitions and other internal and external considerations. In the past, sales force and other restructurings have generally resulted in a temporary lack of focus and reduced productivity. These effects could recur in connection with future acquisitions and other restructurings and our revenues could be negatively affected. 

&#160;

Oracle On Demand and CRM On Demand may not be successful. We offer Oracle On Demand outsourcing services for our applications and database technology, delivered either at our data center facilities, at select partner data centers or at customer facilities. We also offer CRM On Demand, which is a subscription service offering that provides our customers with our CRM software functionality delivered via a hosted, web-based solution that we manage. These business models continue to evolve and we may not be able to compete effectively, generate significant revenues or develop them into profitable businesses. We incur expenses associated with the infrastructures and marketing of our Oracle On Demand and CRM On Demand businesses in advance of our ability to recognize the revenues associated with these offerings. These businesses are subject to a variety of risks including: 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; demand for these services may not meet our expectations; &#160; &#160; &#149; we may not be able to operate these businesses at an acceptable profit level; &#160; &#160; &#149; we manage critical customer applications, data and other confidential information through Oracle On Demand and CRM On Demand; accordingly, we face increased exposure to significant damage claims and risk to future business prospects in the event of system failures, inadequate disaster recovery or loss or misappropriation of customer confidential information; &#160; &#160; &#149; we may face regulatory exposure in certain areas such as data privacy, data security and export compliance, as well as workforce reduction claims as a result of customers transferring their IT functions to us; &#160; &#160; &#149; the laws and regulations applicable to hosted service providers are unsettled, particularly in the areas of privacy and security and use of global resources; changes in these laws could affect our ability to provide services from or to some locations and could increase both the costs and risks associated with providing the services; &#160; &#160; &#149; demand for these services may be affected by customer and media concerns about security risks, international transfers of data, government or other third-party access to data, and/or use of outsourced services providers more generally; and &#160; &#160; &#149; our offerings may require large fixed costs such as for data centers, computers, network infrastructure and security and we may not be able to generate sufficient revenues to offset these costs and generate acceptable operating margins from these offerings. ##TABLE_END &#160;

We might experience significant errors or security flaws in our products and services. Despite testing prior to their release, software products frequently contain errors or security flaws, especially when first introduced or when new versions are released. The detection and correction of any security flaws can be time consuming and costly. Errors in our software products could affect the ability of our products to work with other hardware or software products, could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products and could adversely affect market acceptance of our products. If we experience errors or delays in releasing new products or new versions of products, we could lose revenues. In addition, we run our own business operations, Oracle On Demand, CRM On Demand and other outsourcing services, support and consulting services, on our products and networks and any security flaws, if exploited, could affect our ability to conduct internal business operations. End users, who rely on our products and services for applications that are critical to their businesses, may have a greater sensitivity to product errors and security vulnerabilities than customers for software products generally. Software product errors and security flaws in our products or services could expose us to product liability, performance and/or warranty claims as well as harm our reputation, which could impact our future sales of products and services. In addition, we may be legally required to publicly report security breaches of our services, which could adversely impact future business prospects for those services. 

&#160;

We may not receive significant revenues from our current research and development efforts for several years, if at all. Developing and localizing software is expensive and the investment in product development often involves 

a long return on investment cycle. We have made and expect to continue to make significant investments in software research and development and related product opportunities. Accelerated product introductions and short product life cycles require high levels of expenditures for research and development that could adversely affect our operating results if not offset by revenue increases. We believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position. However, we do not expect to receive significant revenues from these investments for several years if at all. 

&#160;

Our sales to government clients subject us to risks including early termination, audits, investigations, sanctions and penalties. We derive revenues from contracts with the United States government, state and local governments and their respective agencies, which may terminate most of these contracts at any time, without cause. 

&#160;

There is increased pressure for governments and their agencies, both domestically and internationally, to reduce spending. Our federal government contracts are subject to the approval of appropriations being made by the United States Congress to fund the expenditures under these contracts. Similarly, our contracts at the state and local levels are subject to government funding authorizations. 

&#160;

Additionally, government contracts are generally subject to audits and investigations which could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, refund of a portion of fees received, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business. 

&#160;

Business disruptions could affect our operating results. A significant portion of our research and development activities and certain other critical business operations is concentrated in a few geographic areas. We are a highly automated business and a disruption or failure of our systems could cause delays in completing sales and providing services, including some of our On Demand offerings. A major earthquake, fire or other catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our future operating results could be materially and adversely affected. 

&#160;

There are risks associated with our outstanding indebtedness. As of May 31, 2008, we had an aggregate of $11.2 billion of outstanding indebtedness that will mature between 2009 and 2038, and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our ability to pay interest and repay the principal for our indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations, generate sufficient cash flows to service such debt and the other factors discussed in this section. There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks successfully. 

&#160;

We may also need to refinance a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures. There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of our existing debt. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase. In addition, changes by any rating agency to our outlook or credit rating could negatively affect the value of both our debt and equity securities. These risks could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 

&#160;

Adverse litigation results could affect our business. We are subject to various legal proceedings. Litigation can be lengthy, expensive and disruptive to our operations, and results cannot be predicted with certainty. An adverse decision could result in monetary damages or injunctive relief that could affect our business, operating results or financial condition. Additional information regarding certain of the lawsuits we are involved in is discussed under Note 15 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

&#160;

We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities. As a multinational corporation, we are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. 

&#160;

In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many intercompany transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities. Our intercompany transfer pricing is currently being reviewed by the IRS and by foreign tax jurisdictions and will likely be subject to additional audits in the future. We previously negotiated three unilateral Advance Pricing Agreements with the IRS 

that cover many of our intercompany transfer pricing issues and preclude the IRS from making a transfer pricing adjustment within the scope of these agreements. These agreements are effective for fiscal years through May 31, 2006. We have submitted to the IRS a request for renewal of this Advance Pricing Agreement for the years ending May 31, 2007 through May 31, 2011. However, these agreements do not cover all elements of our transfer pricing and do not bind tax authorities outside the United States. We have finalized one bilateral Advance Pricing Agreement, which was effective for the years ending May 31, 2002 through May 31, 2006 and we have submitted a renewal for the years ending May 31, 2007 through May 31, 2011. We currently are negotiating an additional bilateral agreement to cover the period from June 1, 2001 through May 31, 2008. There can be no guarantee that such negotiations will result in an agreement. 

&#160;

Although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable, there is no assurance that the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. 

&#160;

We are also subject to non-income based taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net worth, property and goods and services taxes, in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities with respect to these non-income based taxes and may have exposure to additional non-income based tax liabilities. Our acquisition activities have increased our non-income based tax exposures. 

&#160;

PeopleSoft&#146;s Customer Assurance Program may expose us to substantial liabilities if triggered. In June 2003, in response to our tender offer, PeopleSoft implemented what it referred to as the &#147;customer assurance program&#148; or &#147;CAP&#148;. The CAP incorporated a provision in PeopleSoft&#146;s standard licensing arrangement that purports to contractually burden us, as a result of our acquisition of PeopleSoft, with a contingent obligation to make payments to PeopleSoft customers should we fail to take certain business actions for a fixed period of time after this acquisition. The payment obligation, which typically expires four years from the date of the contract, is fixed at an amount generally between two and five times the license and first year support fees paid to PeopleSoft in the applicable license transaction. We concluded that, as of the date of the PeopleSoft acquisition, the penalty provisions under the CAP represented a contingent liability of ours. The aggregate potential CAP obligation as of May 31, 2008 was $1.9 billion. Some of the CAP provisions have expired or have been removed from these license arrangements. We expect the significant majority of the remaining CAP provisions to expire by the end of calendar 2008. While we have taken extensive steps to assure customers that we intend to continue developing and supporting the PeopleSoft and JD Edwards product lines and, as of May 31, 2008, we have not received any claims for CAP payments, PeopleSoft customers may assert claims for CAP payments. 

&#160;

Our stock price could become more volatile and your investment could lose value. All of the factors discussed in this section could affect our stock price. The timing of announcements in the public market regarding new products, product enhancements or technological advances by our competitors or us, and any announcements by us of acquisitions, major transactions, or management changes could also affect our stock price. Our stock price is subject to speculation in the press and the analyst community, changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by financial analysts, changes in investors&#146; or analysts&#146; valuation measures for our stock, our credit ratings and market trends unrelated to our performance. A significant drop in our stock price could also expose us to the risk of securities class actions lawsuits, which could result in substantial costs and divert management&#146;s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business.

Interest Rate Risk: We generally purchase debt security investments with relatively short maturities (see a description of our debt securities held in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations presented above). Therefore, interest rate movements generally do not materially affect the valuation of our debt security investments. Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest income that is generated from our investments. For fiscal 2008, total interest income was $337 million with investments yielding an average 3.44% on a worldwide basis. This interest rate level was down by 53 basis points from 3.97% for fiscal 2007. If overall interest rates fell by 100 basis points from our average of 3.44% during fiscal 2008, our annual interest income would decline by approximately $95 million, assuming consistent investment levels. The table below presents the cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities balances and the related weighted average interest rates for our investment portfolio at May 31, 2008. The cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities balances are recorded at their fair values at May 31, 2008.

##TABLE_START (1) The 2009 and 2010 Notes bear interest at a floating rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus 0.02% per year and 0.06% per year, respectively. In September 2007, we entered into two interest-rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the variable interest obligations associated with our floating rate senior notes due May 2009 and May 2010 so that the interest payable on the senior notes effectively becomes fixed at a rate of 4.62% and 4.59%, respectively. The critical terms of the interest rate swap agreements and the senior notes that the swap agreements pertain to match, including the notional amounts, interest rate reset dates, maturity dates and underlying market indices. The fair values of the aforementioned interest rate swaps totaled an unrealized loss of $24 million, net of tax effects, at May 31, 2008. We are accounting for these swaps as hedges pursuant to FASB Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities . The unrealized losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income and the corresponding fair value payables are included in other current and long-term liabilities in our condensed consolidated balance sheet. ##TABLE_END &#160;

Foreign Currency Transaction Risk: We transact business in various foreign currencies and have established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risks associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures. Under this program, increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts that we enter into to mitigate the possibility of foreign currency transaction gains or losses. These foreign currency exposures typically arise from intercompany sublicense fees and other intercompany transactions. Our forward contracts generally have terms of 90 days or less. We do not use forward contracts for trading purposes. All outstanding foreign currency forward contracts are marked to market at the end of the period with unrealized gains and losses resulting from fair value changes included in non-operating income, net (the effective portion of our Yen equity hedge described below is included in stockholders&#146; equity). Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to currency fluctuations will depend on the currency exchange rates and other factors in effect as the contracts mature. Net foreign exchange transaction gains included in non-operating income, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations were $17 million, $17 million and $15 million in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The net unrealized gains of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts were $3 million and $5 million at May 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 

&#160;

The tables below present the notional amounts (at contract exchange rates) and the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates for our outstanding forward contracts as of May 31, 2008 and exclude our net 

investment hedge contract described further below. Notional weighted average exchange rates listed in the tables below are quoted using market conventions. All of our forward contracts mature within one year with the substantial majority maturing within 90 days as of May 31, 2008.

Net Investment Risk: We hedge the net assets of certain of our international subsidiaries (net investment hedges) using foreign currency forward contracts to offset the translation and economic exposures related to our investments in these subsidiaries. We measure the effectiveness of our net investment hedges by using the changes in spot exchange rates because this method reflects our risk management strategies, the economics of those strategies in our financial statements and better manages interest rate differentials between different countries. Under this method, the change in fair value of the forward contract attributable to the changes in spot exchange rates (the effective portion) is reported in stockholders&#146; equity to offset the translation results on the net investments. The remaining change in fair value of the forward contract (the excluded portion and the ineffective portion, if any) is recognized in non-operating income, net. 

&#160;

Net gains (losses) on investment hedges reported in stockholders&#146; equity, net of tax effects, were $(53) million, $28 million and $14 million in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Net gains on investment hedges reported in non-operating income, net were $23 million, $28 million and $24 million in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 

&#160;

At May 31, 2008, we had one net investment hedge in Japanese Yen.
