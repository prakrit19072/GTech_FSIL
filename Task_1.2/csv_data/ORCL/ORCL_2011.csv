General 

We are the world&#146;s largest enterprise software company and a leading provider of computer hardware products and services. We develop, manufacture, market, distribute and service database and middleware software; applications software; and hardware systems, consisting primarily of computer server and storage products. Our products are built on industry standards and are engineered to work together or independently within existing customer information technology (IT), including private and public cloud computing, environments. We offer customers secure, reliable, and scalable integrated software and hardware solutions that are designed to improve business efficiencies and more easily adapt to an organization&#146;s unique needs, at a lower total cost of ownership. We seek to be an industry leader in each of the specific product categories in which we compete and to expand into new and emerging markets. 

We believe our internal growth and continued innovation with respect to our software, hardware and services businesses are the foundation of our long-term strategic plans. An important element of our continued innovation and product strategy is to focus the engineering of our hardware and software products to make them work together more effectively and deliver improved computing performance, reliability and security to our customers. Our Oracle Exadata Database Machine and Oracle Exalogic Elastic Cloud products exemplify this strategy and are currently two of our most important products. Both products combine certain of our hardware and software offerings to provide an engineered system that increases computing performance relative to our competitors&#146; products, creating time savings and operational cost advantages for our customers. In fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 we invested $4.5 billion, $3.3 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively, in research and development to enhance our existing portfolio of products and services and to develop new products and services. 

We also believe that an active acquisition program is an important element of our corporate strategy as it strengthens our competitive position, enhances the products and services that we can offer to customers, expands our customer base, provides greater scale to accelerate innovation, grows our revenues and earnings, and increases stockholder value. In recent years, we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of companies, products, services and technologies that add to, are complementary to, or have otherwise enhanced our existing offerings. We expect to continue to acquire companies, products, services and technologies in furtherance of our corporate strategy.

Software, Hardware Systems and Services 

We are organized into three businesses&#151;software, hardware systems, and services&#151;which are further divided into seven operating segments. Our software business is comprised of two operating segments: (1) new software licenses and (2) software license updates and product support. Our hardware systems business consists of two operating segments: (1) hardware systems products and (2) hardware systems support. Our services business is comprised of three operating segments: (1) consulting, (2) Cloud Services and (3) education. Our software, hardware systems, and services businesses represented 68%, 19%, and 13% of our total revenues, respectively, in fiscal 2011 and 77%, 9% and 14%, respectively, in fiscal 2010. Prior to our acquisition of Sun Microsystems, Inc. (Sun) in January 2010, we did not have a hardware systems business. Our software and services businesses represented 81% and 19% of our total revenues, respectively, in fiscal 2009. See Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our operating segments. 

Our software, hardware systems, and services businesses provide the products and services necessary to run various IT environments, including cloud computing environments.

We seek to protect and enhance our customers&#146; current investments in Oracle software by offering proactive and personalized support services, including our Lifetime Support policy, and unspecified product enhancements and upgrades. Software license updates provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades and maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period. Product support includes internet and telephone access to technical support personnel located in our global support centers, as well as internet access to technical content through &#147;My Oracle Support.&#148; Software license updates and product support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net new software license fees. Substantially all of our customers purchase software license updates and product support contracts when they acquire new software licenses and renew their software license updates and product support contracts annually. Our software license updates and product support revenues represented 42%, 49% and 50% of our total revenues in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. 

Hardware Systems Business 

As a result of our acquisition of Sun in January 2010, we entered into the hardware systems business. Our hardware systems business consists of two operating segments: hardware systems products and hardware systems support. 

Hardware Systems Products 

Our customers demand a broad set of hardware systems solutions to manage growing amounts of data and computational requirements, to meet increasing compliance and regulatory demands, and to reduce energy, space, and operational costs. To meet these demands, we have a wide variety of innovative hardware systems offerings, including servers and storage products, networking components, operating systems and other hardware-related software. Our hardware systems component products are designed to be &#147;open,&#148; or to work in customer environments that may include other Oracle or non-Oracle hardware or software components. We have also engineered our hardware systems products to create performance and operational cost advantages for customers when our hardware and software products are combined as engineered systems, as with Oracle Exadata and Oracle Exalogic Elastic Cloud. By combining our server and storage hardware with our software, our open, integrated products better address customer requirements for performance, scalability, reliability, security, ease of management, and lower total cost of ownership. Our hardware systems products represented 12% and 6% of our total revenues in fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. 

Servers 

We offer a wide range of server systems using our SPARC microprocessor. Our SPARC servers are differentiated by their reliability, security and scalability; and by the customer environments that they target (general purpose or specialized systems). Our midsize and large servers are designed to offer greater performance and lower total cost of ownership than mainframe systems for business critical applications and for customers having more computationally intensive needs. Our SPARC servers run the Oracle Solaris operating system and are designed for the most demanding mission critical enterprise environments at any scale. We have a long-standing relationship with Fujitsu Limited for the development, manufacturing and marketing of certain of our SPARC server components and products. 

&#160; 

We also offer a wide range of x86 servers. These x86 servers are primarily based on microprocessor platforms from Intel Corporation (Intel) and are also compatible with Oracle Solaris, Oracle Linux, Microsoft Windows and other operating systems. 

We offer a line of products aimed at the unique needs of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and network equipment providers (NEPs). Rack-optimized systems and our blade product offerings combine high-density hardware architecture and system management software that OEMs find particularly useful in building their own solution architectures. Our NEP-certified Sun Netra systems are designed to meet the specialized needs of NEPs. 

Storage 

Our storage products are designed to securely manage, protect, archive and restore customers&#146; mission critical data assets and consist of tape, disk, hardware-related software including file systems software, back-up and archive software and storage management software, and networking for mainframe and open systems environments. Our storage products are designed to improve data availability by providing fast data access and dynamic data protection for restoration and secure archiving for compliance. 

Our tape storage product line includes StorageTEK libraries, drives, virtualization systems, media and device software. These products are intended to provide robust solutions for both long-term preservation and near-term protection, of customer data at a lower total cost of ownership. 

Our disk storage product lines include data center arrays, mid-range arrays, unified storage, network attached storage, and entry level systems. We also offer software for management and efficient resource utilization and virtualization of storage resources. 

Networking 

We create networking components and products designed to efficiently connect and deploy server and storage clusters in data centers. The development of our networking products includes both hardware and software development for the InfiniBand and Ethernet technologies that are used with our server and storage products and are integrated into our management tools. 

Oracle Solaris and Oracle Linux Operating Systems and Hardware-Related Software 

The Oracle Solaris operating system is designed to provide a reliable, secure and scalable operating system environment through significant core feature development in kernel, networking, security, and file system technologies as well as close integration with hardware features. This design provides us with an ability to combine Oracle Solaris with our own hardware components to achieve certain performance and efficiency advantages in comparison to our competitors. The Oracle Solaris operating system is based on the UNIX operating system, but is unique among UNIX systems in that it is available on our SPARC servers and x86 servers that are substantially based upon microprocessors from Intel. We also support Oracle Solaris deployed on other companies&#146; hardware products. 

The Oracle Linux operating system with Oracle&#146;s Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel is a Linux operating system for enterprise workloads including databases, middleware and applications. Oracle Linux supports x86 based systems. 

In addition to Oracle Solaris and Oracle Linux operating systems, we also develop a range of other hardware-related software, including development tools, compilers, management tools for servers and storage, diagnostic tools, virtualization and file systems. 

Hardware Systems Support 

Customers that purchase our hardware systems products may also elect to purchase our hardware systems support offerings. Our hardware systems support offerings provide customers with software updates for the software components that are essential to the functionality of our server and storage products, such as Oracle Solaris, and can include product repairs, maintenance services, and technical support services. We continue to focus on 

&#160; 

identifying hardware systems support processes that are intended to proactively identify and solve quality issues and to increase the amount of new hardware systems support contracts sold in connection with the sales of our hardware systems products. Hardware systems support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net hardware systems products fees. Our hardware systems support revenues represented 7% and 3% of our total revenues in fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. 

Services Business 

Our services business consists of consulting, Cloud Services and education. 

Consulting 

Oracle Consulting is designed to help our customers more successfully deploy our products. Our consulting services include business and IT strategy alignment, enterprise architecture planning and design, initial product implementation and integration, and ongoing product enhancements and upgrades. Together, these services are designed to help our customers achieve their business goals, reduce the risk associated with their IT initiatives, and maximize their return on investment. Oracle Consulting engages customers directly and provides specialized expertise to our global systems integrator partners. We utilize a global, blended delivery model to optimize value for our customers and partners, consisting of on-site consultants from local geographies, industry specialists and consultants from our global delivery and solution centers. Consulting revenues represented 8%, 10% and 14% of total revenues in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. 

Cloud Services 

Our Cloud Services segment, which was formerly named On Demand, includes certain of our Oracle Cloud Services offerings and technology, and Advanced Customer Services. We believe that our Cloud Services offerings provide our customers with increased business performance, reduced risk, a predictable cost and more flexibility and choice in terms of service in order to maximize the performance of their Oracle software and hardware products and services. 

Oracle Cloud Services are designed to provide comprehensive software and hardware management and maintenance services for customers hosted at Oracle data center facilities, select partner data centers or physically on-site at customer facilities. Advanced Customer Services provides support services, both onsite and remote, to Oracle customers to enable increased performance and higher availability of their products and services. 

Cloud Services revenues represented 4% of total revenues in fiscal 2011 and 3% of total revenues in each of fiscal 2010 and 2009. 

Education 

We provide training to customers, partners and employees as a part of our mission of accelerating the adoption and use of our software and hardware products and to create opportunities to grow our product revenues. Our training is provided through a variety of formats, including instructor-led classes at our education centers, live virtual training, self-paced online training, training via CD-ROM, private events and custom training. Our live virtual class offerings allow students anywhere in the world to receive real-time, interactive training online. In addition, we also offer a certification program certifying database administrators, developers, implementers, consultants and architects. Education revenues represented 1% of total revenues in each of fiscal 2011 and 2010 and 2% of our total revenues in fiscal 2009. 

Marketing and Sales 

We directly market and sell our products and services to businesses of many sizes and in many industries, government agencies and educational institutions. We also market, and sell our products through indirect channels. No single customer accounted for 10% or more of our total revenues in fiscal 2011, 2010 or 2009. 

&#160; 

In the United States, our sales and service employees are based in our headquarters and in field offices throughout the country. Outside the United States, our international subsidiaries sell and support our products in their local countries as well as within other foreign countries where we do not operate through a direct sales subsidiary. Our geographic coverage allows us to draw on business and technical expertise from a global workforce, provides stability to our operations and revenue streams to offset geography-specific economic trends and offers us an opportunity to take advantage of new markets for our products. Our international operations subject us to certain risks, which are more fully described in &#147;Risk Factors&#148; included in Item 1A. of this Annual Report. A summary of our domestic and international revenues and long-lived assets is set forth in Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

We also market our products worldwide through indirect channels. The companies that comprise our indirect channel network are members of the Oracle Partner Network. The Oracle Partner Network is a global program that manages our business relationships with a large, broad-based network of companies, including independent software and hardware vendors, system integrators and resellers who deliver innovative solutions and services based upon our products. By offering our partners access to our premier products, educational information, technical services, marketing and sales support, the Oracle Partner Network program extends our market reach by providing our partners with the resources they need to be successful in delivering solutions to customers globally. The majority of our hardware systems products are sold through indirect channels, including independent distributors and value added resellers. We have enhanced direct sales coverage for our hardware systems products and intend that our direct sales force will sell proportionately more of our hardware systems products in the future than they do currently. 

Seasonality and Cyclicality 

Our quarterly results reflect distinct seasonality in the sale of our products and services. Our total revenues and operating margins are typically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter and lowest in our first fiscal quarter. General economic conditions also have an impact on our business and financial results. The markets in which we sell our products and services have, at times, experienced weak economic conditions that have negatively affected our revenues. See &#147;Selected Quarterly Financial Data&#148; in Item 7 of this Annual Report for a more complete description of the seasonality and cyclicality of our revenues, expenses and margins. 

Competition 

We face intense competition in all aspects of our business. The nature of the IT industry creates a competitive landscape that is constantly evolving as firms emerge, expand or are acquired, as technology evolves and as customer demands and competitive pressures otherwise change. 

Our customers are demanding less complexity and lower total cost in the implementation, sourcing, integration and ongoing maintenance of their enterprise software and hardware systems, which has led increasingly to our product offerings being viewed as a &#147;stack&#148; of software and hardware designed to work together in a standards-compliant environment. Our enterprise software and hardware offerings compete directly with some offerings from the most competitive companies in the world, including Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft), International Business Machines Corporation (IBM), Hewlett-Packard Company (HP), SAP AG, and Intel, as well as many others. In addition, the low barriers to entry in many of our market segments regularly introduce new technologies and new and growing competitors to challenge our offerings. Our competitors range from companies offering broad IT solutions across many of our lines of business to vendors providing point solutions, or offerings focused on a specific functionality, product area or industry. In addition, as we expand into new market segments, we will face increased competition as we will compete with existing competitors, as well as firms that may be partners in other areas of our business and other firms with whom we have not previously competed. Moreover, we or our competitors may take certain strategic actions&#151;including acquisitions, partnerships and joint ventures, or repositioning of product lines&#151;which invite even greater competition in one or more product categories. 

&#160; 

Key competitive factors in each of the segments in which we currently compete and may compete in the future include: total cost of ownership, performance, scalability, reliability, security, functionality, efficiency, ease of management and quality of technical support. Our product sales (and the relative strength of our products versus those of our competitors) are also directly and indirectly affected by the following, among other things: 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; the broader &#147;platform&#148; competition between our industry standard Java technology platform and the .NET programming environment of Microsoft; 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; operating system competition among, primarily, our Oracle Solaris operating system, Microsoft&#146;s Windows Server, UNIX (including HP-UX from HP and AIX from IBM) and Linux; 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; the adoption of SaaS, hosted or cloud software offerings; 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; the adoption of commodity servers and microprocessors; 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; the adoption of open source alternatives to commercial software by enterprise software customers; 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; products, features and functionality developed internally by customers and their IT staff; 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; products, features or functionality customized and implemented for customers by consultants, systems integrators or other third parties; and 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; attractiveness of offerings from business processing outsourcers. 

##TABLE_END For more information about the competitive risks we face, refer to Item 1A. &#147;Risk Factors.&#148; 

Manufacturing 

To produce our hardware systems products, we rely on both our internal manufacturing operations as well as third party manufacturing partners. Our internal manufacturing operations consist primarily of final assembly, test and quality control of our enterprise and data center servers and storage systems. For all other manufacturing, we rely on third party manufacturing partners. We distribute most of our hardware systems products either from our facilities or partner facilities. Our manufacturing processes are based on standardization of components across product types, centralization of assembly and distribution centers and a &#147;build-to-order&#148; methodology in which products are built only after customers have placed firm orders. Production of our hardware products requires that we purchase materials, supplies, product subassemblies and full assemblies from a number of vendors. For most of our hardware products, we have existing alternate sources of supply or such sources are readily available. However, we do rely on sole sources for certain of our hardware products. For example, we have a long-standing relationship with Fujitsu Limited for the development, manufacturing and marketing of certain of our SPARC server components and products. As a result, we continue to monitor the situation in Japan caused by the recent earthquake and tsunami and will continue to evaluate the resulting potential risks of disruption to our supply chain operations. Refer to &#147;Risk Factors&#148; included in Item 1A. of this Annual Report for additional discussion of the challenges we encounter with respect to the sources and availability of supplies for our products and the related risks to our business. 

Research and Development 

We develop the substantial majority of our products internally. In addition, we have extended our product offerings and intellectual property through acquisitions of businesses and technologies. We also purchase or license intellectual property rights in certain circumstances. Internal development allows us to maintain technical control over the design and development of our products. We have a number of United States and foreign patents and pending applications that relate to various aspects of our products and technology. While we believe that our patents have value, no single patent is essential to us or to any of our principal business segments. Research and development expenditures were $4.5 billion, $3.3 billion and $2.8 billion in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, or 13% of total revenues in fiscal 2011 and 12% of total revenues in each of fiscal 2010 and 2009. Rapid technological advances in hardware and software development, evolving standards in computer hardware and software technology, changing customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements characterize the software and hardware markets in which we compete. We plan to continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to research and development efforts to maintain and improve our current product and services offerings. 

&#160; 

Employees 

As of May 31, 2011, we employed approximately 108,000 full-time employees, including approximately 27,000 in sales and marketing, approximately 9,000 in software license updates and product support, approximately 1,000 in the manufacturing of our hardware systems products, approximately 6,000 in hardware systems support, approximately 25,000 in services, approximately 30,000 in research and development and approximately 10,000 in general and administrative positions. Of these employees, approximately 39,000 were located in the United States and approximately 69,000 were employed internationally. None of our employees in the United States is represented by a labor union; however, in certain foreign subsidiaries workers&#146; councils represent our employees.

"
1A," Item 1A. Risk Factors 

We operate in a rapidly changing economic and technological environment that presents numerous risks, many of which are driven by factors that we cannot control or predict. The following discussion, as well as our &#147;Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates&#148; discussion in Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Item 7), highlights some of these risks. The risks described below are not exhaustive and you should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our securities. 

Economic, political and market conditions, including the recent recession and global economic crisis, can adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, including our revenue growth and profitability, which in turn could adversely affect our stock price. Our business is influenced by a range of factors that are beyond our control and that we have no comparative advantage in forecasting. These include: 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; general economic and business conditions; 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; the overall demand for enterprise software, hardware systems and services; 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; governmental budgetary constraints or shifts in government spending priorities; 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; general political developments; and 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; currency exchange rate fluctuations. 

##TABLE_END Macroeconomic developments like the recent recessions in the U.S. and Europe and the debt crisis in certain countries in the European Union could negatively affect our business, operating results or financial condition which, in turn, could adversely affect our stock price. A general weakening of, and related declining corporate confidence in, the global economy or the curtailment in government or corporate spending could cause current or potential customers to reduce their information technology (IT) budgets or be unable to fund software, hardware systems or services purchases, which could cause customers to delay, decrease or cancel purchases of our products and services or cause customers not to pay us or to delay paying us for previously purchased products and services. 

In addition, political unrest in regions like the Middle East, terrorist attacks around the globe and the potential for other hostilities in various parts of the world, potential public health crises and natural disasters, including the earthquake and resulting tsunami in Japan, continue to contribute to a climate of economic and political uncertainty that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, including our revenue growth and profitability. These factors generally have the strongest effect on our sales of new software licenses, hardware systems products, hardware systems support and related services and, to a lesser extent, also may affect our renewal rates for software license updates and product support. 

We may fail to achieve our financial forecasts due to inaccurate sales forecasts or other factors. Our revenues, and particularly our new software license revenues and hardware systems products revenues, are difficult to forecast, and, as a result, our quarterly operating results can fluctuate substantially. Our limited experience with managing our new hardware business and forecasting its future financial results creates additional challenges with our forecasting processes. 

We use a &#147;pipeline&#148; system, a common industry practice, to forecast sales and trends in our business. Our sales personnel monitor the status of all proposals and estimate when a customer will make a purchase decision and the dollar amount of the sale. These estimates are aggregated periodically to generate a sales pipeline. Our pipeline estimates can prove to be unreliable both in a particular quarter and over a longer period of time, in part because the &#147;conversion rate&#148; or &#147;closure rate&#148; of the pipeline into contracts can be very difficult to estimate. A contraction in the conversion rate, or in the pipeline itself, could cause us to plan or budget incorrectly and adversely affect our business or results of operations. In particular, a slowdown in IT spending or economic conditions generally can unexpectedly reduce the conversion rate in particular periods as purchasing decisions are delayed, reduced in amount or cancelled. The conversion rate can also be affected by the tendency of some of our customers to wait until the end of a fiscal period in the hope of obtaining more favorable terms, which can also impede our ability to negotiate, execute and deliver upon these contracts in a timely manner. In addition, for newly acquired companies, we have limited ability to predict how their pipelines will convert into sales or 

&#160; 

revenues for a number of quarters following the acquisition, and potentially longer with respect to our acquisition of Sun Microsystems, Inc. (Sun). Conversion rates post-acquisition may be quite different from the acquired companies&#146; historical conversion rates. Differences in conversion rates can also be affected by changes in our business practices that we implement with our newly acquired companies that may affect customer behavior. 

A substantial portion of our new software license revenue contracts and hardware systems products contracts is completed in the latter part of a quarter and a significant percentage of these are large orders. Because a significant portion of our cost structure is largely fixed in the short-term, revenue shortfalls tend to have a disproportionately negative impact on our profitability. The number of large new software license transactions, and to a lesser extent hardware systems products transactions, also increases the risk of fluctuations in our quarterly results because a delay in even a small number of these transactions could cause our quarterly revenues and profitability to fall significantly short of our predictions. 

Our success depends upon our ability to develop new products and services, integrate acquired products and services and enhance our existing products and services. Rapid technological advances and evolving standards in computer hardware and software development and communications infrastructure, changing and increasingly sophisticated customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements characterize the enterprise software and hardware systems markets in which we compete. If we are unable to develop new or sufficiently differentiated products and services, or enhance and improve our products and support services in a timely manner or to position and/or price our products and services to meet market demand, customers may not buy new software licenses or hardware systems products or purchase or renew software license updates and product support or hardware systems support contracts. Renewals of these support contracts are important to the growth of our business. In addition, IT standards from both consortia and formal standards-setting forums as well as de facto marketplace standards are rapidly evolving. We cannot provide any assurance that the standards on which we choose to develop new products will allow us to compete effectively for business opportunities in emerging areas. 

We have recently released Oracle Fusion Applications, the next generation of our applications software offerings, which are being designed to unify the best-of-business functional capabilities from all of our applications on a modern Internet-based middleware technology foundation. We have also recently designed and built the Exadata Database Machine, a fast database warehousing machine that runs online transaction processing applications, and the Exalogic Elastic Cloud, an integrated &#147;cloud&#148; machine which has server hardware and middleware software that have been engineered together. If we do not continue to develop and release these or other new or enhanced products and services within the anticipated time frames, if there is a delay in market acceptance of a new, enhanced or acquired product line or service, if we do not timely optimize complementary product lines and services or if we fail to adequately integrate, support or enhance acquired product lines or services, our business may be adversely affected. 

If we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new hardware systems or software competitors, the results of operations and prospects for our business could be harmed through fewer customer orders, reduced pricing, lower revenues or lower profits. Our hardware systems business will compete with, among others, (i) systems manufacturers and resellers of systems based on our own microprocessors and operating systems and those of our competitors, (ii) microprocessor/chip manufacturers and (iii) providers of storage products. Our hardware systems business may also cause us to compete with companies who historically have been our partners. These competitors may have more experience than we do in managing a hardware business. A large portion of our hardware products are based on our SPARC microprocessor and Oracle Solaris operating system platform, which has a smaller installed base than certain of our competitors&#146; platforms and which may make it difficult for us to win new customers that have already made significant investments in our competitors&#146; platforms. Certain of these competitors also compete very aggressively on price. A loss in our competitive position could result in lower revenues or profitability, which could adversely impact our ability to realize the revenue and profitability forecasts for our hardware systems business. 

Many vendors develop and market databases, middleware products, application development tools, business applications, collaboration products and business intelligence products that compete with our software offerings. In addition, several companies offer Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) or cloud computing and business process 

&#160; 

outsourcing (BPO) as competitive alternatives to buying software and hardware, and customer interest in SaaS or cloud and BPO solutions is increasing. Some of these competitors have greater financial or technical resources than we do. Our competitors that offer business applications and middleware products may influence a customer&#146;s purchasing decision for the underlying database in an effort to persuade potential customers not to acquire our products. We could lose customers if our competitors introduce new competitive products, add new functionality, acquire competitive products, reduce prices or form strategic alliances with other companies. Vendors that offer SaaS, cloud or BPO solutions may persuade our customers not to purchase our products. We may also face increasing competition from open source software initiatives, in which competitors may provide software and intellectual property for free. Existing or new competitors could gain sales opportunities or customers at our expense. 

Our hardware systems offerings are complex products. If we cannot successfully manage the required processes to meet customer requirements and demand on a timely basis, the results of our hardware systems business will suffer. Designing, developing, manufacturing and introducing new hardware systems products are complicated processes. The development process is uncertain and requires a high level of innovation from both systems hardware and software product designers and engineers and the suppliers of the components used in these products. The development process is also lengthy and costly. Once a new hardware systems product is developed, we face several challenges in the manufacturing process. We must be able to forecast customer demand and manufacture new hardware systems products in sufficient volumes to meet this demand and do so in a cost effective manner. Our &#147;build-to-order&#148; manufacturing model, in which our hardware systems products are not fully assembled until after customers place orders, may from time to time experience delays in delivering our hardware systems products to customers in a timely manner. These delays could cause our customers to purchase hardware products and services from our competitors. We must also manage new hardware product introductions and transitions to minimize the impact of customer delayed purchases of existing hardware systems products in anticipation of new hardware systems product releases. Because the design and manufacturing processes for components are also very complicated, it is possible that we could experience design or manufacturing flaws. These design or manufacturing flaws could delay or prevent the production of the components for which we have previously committed to pay or need to fulfill orders from customers. These types of component flaws could also prevent the production of our hardware products or cause our hardware products to be returned, recalled or rejected resulting in lost revenues, increases in warranty costs or costs related to remediation efforts, damage to our reputation, penalties and litigation. 

Acquisitions present many risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of a transaction. In recent years, we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of companies, products, services and technologies. An active acquisition program is an important element of our overall corporate strategy, and we expect to continue to make similar acquisitions in the future. Risks we may face in connection with our acquisition program include: 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; our ongoing business may be disrupted and our management&#146;s attention may be diverted by acquisition, transition or integration activities; 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; an acquisition may not further our business strategy as we expected, we may not integrate an acquired company or technology as successfully as we expected or we may overpay for, or otherwise not realize the expected return on, our investments, which could adversely affect our business or operating results; 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; we may have difficulties (i) managing an acquired company&#146;s technologies or lines of business or (ii) entering new markets where we have no or limited direct prior experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions; 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; our operating results or financial condition may be adversely impacted by claims or liabilities that we assume from an acquired company or technology or that are otherwise related to an acquisition, including claims from government agencies, terminated employees, current or former customers, former stockholders or other third parties; pre-existing contractual relationships of an acquired company that we would not have otherwise entered into, the termination or modification of which may be costly or disruptive to our business; unfavorable revenue recognition or other accounting treatment as a result of an acquired company&#146;s practices; and intellectual property claims or disputes; 

##TABLE_END &#160; 

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; we may fail to identify or assess the magnitude of certain liabilities, shortcomings or other circumstances prior to acquiring a company or technology, which could result in unexpected litigation or regulatory exposure, unfavorable accounting treatment, unexpected increases in taxes due, a loss of anticipated tax benefits or other adverse effects on our business, operating results or financial condition; 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; we may not realize the anticipated increase in our revenues from an acquisition for a number of reasons, including if a larger than predicted number of customers decline to renew software license updates and product support contracts and hardware systems support contracts, if we are unable to sell the acquired products to our customer base or if contract models of an acquired company do not allow us to recognize revenues on a timely basis; 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; we may have difficulty incorporating acquired technologies or products with our existing product lines and maintaining uniform standards, architecture, controls, procedures and policies; 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; we may have multiple product lines as a result of our acquisitions that are offered, priced and supported differently, which could cause customer confusion and delays; 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; we may have higher than anticipated costs in continuing support and development of acquired products, in general and administrative functions that support new business models, or in compliance with associated regulations that are more complicated than we had anticipated; 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; we may be unable to obtain timely approvals from, or may otherwise have certain limitations, restrictions, penalties or other sanctions imposed on us by, worker councils or similar bodies under applicable employment laws as a result of an acquisition, which could adversely affect our integration plans in certain jurisdictions; 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; we may be unable to obtain required approvals from governmental authorities under competition and antitrust laws on a timely basis, if at all, which could, among other things, delay or prevent us from completing a transaction, otherwise restrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic goals of an acquisition or have other adverse effects on our current business and operations; 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; our use of cash to pay for acquisitions may limit other potential uses of our cash, including stock repurchases, dividend payments and retirement of outstanding indebtedness; 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; we may significantly increase our interest expense, leverage and debt service requirements if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition and we may have to delay or not proceed with a substantial acquisition if we cannot obtain the necessary funding to complete the acquisition in a timely manner or on favorable terms; 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; to the extent that we issue a significant amount of equity securities in connection with future acquisitions, existing stockholders may be diluted and earnings per share may decrease; and 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; we may experience additional or unexpected changes in how we are required to account for our acquisitions pursuant to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, including arrangements that we assume from an acquisition. 

##TABLE_END The occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows, particularly in the case of a larger acquisition or several concurrent acquisitions. 

Our international sales and operations subject us to additional risks that can adversely affect our operating results. We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from, and have significant operations, outside of the United States. Our international operations include software and hardware systems development, manufacturing, assembly, sales, customer support, consulting, Cloud Services and shared administrative service centers. 

Compliance with international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. These laws and regulations include U.S. laws and local laws which include data privacy requirements, labor relations laws, tax laws, anti-competition regulations, prohibitions on payments to governmental officials, import and trade restrictions, and export requirements. 

&#160; 

Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business. Any such violations could result in prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries, could delay or prevent potential acquisitions, and could also materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and our operating results. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these difficulties. We monitor our international operations and investigate allegations of improprieties relating to transactions and the way in which such transactions are recorded. Where circumstances warrant, we provide information and report our findings to government authorities, but no assurance can be given that action will not be taken by such authorities. 

We are also subject to a variety of other risks and challenges in managing an organization operating in various countries, including those related to: 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; general economic conditions in each country or region; 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; fluctuations in currency exchange rates and related impacts to our operating results; 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; natural disasters, like the recent earthquake and resulting tsunami in Japan; 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; regulatory changes; 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; political unrest, terrorism and the potential for other hostilities; 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; public health risks, particularly in areas in which we have significant operations; 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; longer payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable; 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; overlapping tax regimes; 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; our ability to repatriate funds held by our foreign subsidiaries to the United States at favorable tax rates; 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; difficulties in transferring funds from or converting currencies in certain countries; and 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries. 

##TABLE_END As a result of our hardware systems business, the volume and complexity of laws and regulations that we are subject to have increased. The variety of risks and challenges listed above could also disrupt or otherwise negatively impact the supply chain operations for our hardware systems products segment and the sales of our products and services in affected countries or regions. 

As the majority shareholder of Oracle Financial Services Software Limited, a publicly traded Indian software company focused on the banking industry, we are faced with several additional risks, including being subject to local securities regulations and being unable to exert full control. 

We may not achieve our financial forecasts with respect to our acquisition of Sun or our hardware systems business, or the achievement of such forecasts may take longer than expected. Our profitability could decline if we do not manage the risks associated with our hardware systems business. Our hardware systems business may adversely affect our overall profitability if we do not manage the associated risks. We may not achieve our estimated revenue, profit or other financial projections with respect to our acquisition of Sun in a timely manner or at all due to a number of factors, including: 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; our relative inexperience in managing a hardware systems business and related processes or the unplanned departures of some important employees could adversely impact our ability to successfully run our hardware systems business, which could adversely impact our ability to realize the forecasts for our hardware systems business and its results of operations; 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; we may not be able to increase sales of hardware systems support contracts or such increase may take longer than we anticipate, which could result in lower revenues and profitability, or slower than expected growth of such revenues and profitability; 

##TABLE_END &#160; 

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; our hardware systems business has higher expenses as a percentage of revenues, and thus has been less profitable, than our software business. We have reported, and may continue to report, lower overall operating margins as a percentage of revenues, and we may not achieve our profit margin levels that we attained prior to our acquisition of Sun; 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; we face a greater risk of potential write-downs and impairments of inventory, higher warranty expenses than we had historically encountered in our existing software and services businesses, and higher amortization from, and potential impairment of, intangible assets associated with our hardware systems business. Any of these items could result in material charges and adversely affect our operating results; and 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; we may forgo sales opportunities, customers and revenues as a result of our reducing the resale of third party products and services for which Sun historically acted as a reseller. 

##TABLE_END Our strategy of transitioning to a mixed direct and indirect sales model for our hardware systems products may not succeed and could result in lower hardware revenues or profits. Disruptions to our software indirect sales channel could affect our future operating results. Although we will continue to sell our hardware systems products through indirect channels, including independent distributors and value added resellers, we have enhanced our direct sales coverage for our hardware products and intend that our direct sales force will sell a larger portion of our hardware products in the future than they do now. These direct sales efforts, however, may not be successful. Our relationships with some of our channel partners may deteriorate because we are reducing our reliance on some of these partners for sales of our hardware products, are modifying our approach and timing to the manufacturing of our products and are altering certain of Sun&#146;s legacy business practices with these channel partners, which could result in reduced demand from the channel partners or certain customer segments serviced by these channel partners. Some hardware revenues from channel partners may not be replaced by revenues generated from our own sales personnel or may not be replaced as quickly as we expect. In addition, we may not be able to hire qualified hardware salespeople, sales consultants and other personnel for our direct sales model at the rate or in the numbers we need to generate the hardware revenues and profit margins we have projected for future periods. Even if we can meet our hiring needs, these salespeople may not be able to achieve our sales forecasts for our hardware business. If we experience any of these risks, our hardware revenues or profits may decline. 

Our software indirect channel network is comprised primarily of resellers, system integrators/implementers, consultants, education providers, internet service providers, network integrators and independent software vendors. Our relationships with these channel participants are important elements of our software marketing and sales efforts. Our financial results could be adversely affected if our contracts with channel participants were terminated, if our relationships with channel participants were to deteriorate, if any of our competitors enter into strategic relationships with or acquire a significant channel participant or if the financial condition of our channel participants were to weaken. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in maintaining, expanding or developing our relationships with channel participants. If we are not successful, we may lose sales opportunities, customers and revenues. 

We may experience foreign currency gains and losses. We conduct a significant number of transactions in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Changes in the value of major foreign currencies, particularly the Euro, Japanese Yen and British Pound relative to the U.S. Dollar can significantly affect revenues and our operating results. Generally, our revenues and operating results are adversely affected when the dollar strengthens relative to other currencies and are positively affected when the dollar weakens. 

In addition, we incur foreign currency transaction gains and losses, primarily related to sublicense fees and other intercompany agreements among us and our subsidiaries that we expect to cash settle in the near term, which are charged against earnings in the period incurred. We have a program, which primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risks associated with these foreign currency exposures that we may suspend from time to time. This program was suspended for part of fiscal 2011 but was reactivated during our second quarter of fiscal 2011. As a part of this program, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts in order to mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currency transaction gains or 

&#160; 

losses. Although we have resumed our foreign currency forward contract program, a large portion of our consolidated operations are international and we expect that we will continue to realize gains or losses with respect to our foreign currency exposures, net of gains or losses from our foreign currency forward contracts. For example, we will experience foreign currency gains and losses in certain instances if it is not possible or cost effective to hedge our foreign currency exposures or should we suspend our foreign currency forward contract program in the future. Our ultimate realized loss or gain with respect to currency fluctuations will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency exposures that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, whether we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to offset these exposures and other factors. All of these factors could materially impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows, the timing of which is variable and generally outside of our control. 

The future operating results of our hardware systems business will depend on our ability to manage our component inventory to meet the demands of our hardware systems customers and to avoid component inventory write-downs. We depend on suppliers to design, develop, manufacture and deliver on a timely basis the necessary components for our hardware products. While many of the components purchased are standard, some components (standard or otherwise) require long lead times to manufacture and deliver. Furthermore, there are some components that can only be purchased from a single vendor due to price, quality, technology or other business constraints. As a result, our supply chain operations could be disrupted or negatively impacted by natural disasters such as the recent earthquake and tsunami in Japan, political unrest or other factors affecting the countries or regions where these single source component vendors are located. We may be unable to purchase these items from the respective single vendors on acceptable terms or may experience significant delays or quality issues in the delivery of necessary parts or components from a particular vendor. If we had to find a new supplier for these parts and components, hardware systems product shipments could be delayed, which would adversely affect our hardware systems revenues. We could also experience fluctuations in component prices which, if unanticipated, could negatively impact our hardware systems business cost structure. These factors may make it difficult for us to plan and procure appropriate component inventory levels in a timely fashion to meet customer demand for our hardware products. Therefore we may experience component inventory shortages which may result in production delays or customers choosing to purchase fewer hardware products from us or systems products from our competitors. We negotiate supply commitments with vendors early in the manufacturing process to ensure we have sufficient components for our hardware products to meet anticipated customer demand. We must also manage our levels of older component inventories used in our hardware products to minimize inventory write-offs or write-downs. If we have excess inventory, it may be necessary to write-down the inventory, which would adversely affect our operating results. If one or more of the risks described above occurs, our hardware systems business and related operating results could be materially and adversely affected. 

We expect to continue to depend on third party manufacturers to build certain hardware systems products and third party logistics providers to deliver our products. As such, we are susceptible to manufacturing and logistics delays that could prevent us from shipping customer orders on time, if at all, and may result in the loss of sales and customers. We outsource the manufacturing, assembly and delivery of certain of our hardware products to a variety of companies, many of which are located outside the United States. Our reliance on these third parties reduces our control over the manufacturing and delivery process, exposing us to risks, including reduced control over quality assurance, product costs, product supply and delivery delays as well as the political and economic uncertainties of the international locations where certain of these third party manufacturers have facilities and operations. Any manufacturing disruption or logistics delays by these third parties could impair our ability to fulfill orders for these hardware systems products. If we are unable to manage our relationships with these third parties effectively, or if these third parties experience delays, disruptions, capacity constraints, regulatory issues or quality control problems in their operations, or fail to meet our future requirements for timely delivery, our ability to ship and/or deliver certain of our hardware systems products to our customers could be impaired and our hardware systems business could be harmed. 

We have simplified our supply chain processes by reducing the number of third party manufacturing partners on which Sun had historically relied and the number of locations where these third party manufacturers build our 

&#160; 

hardware systems products. We therefore have become more dependent on a fewer number of these manufacturing partners and locations. If these partners experience production problems or delays or cannot meet our demand for products, we may not be able to find alternate manufacturing sources in a timely or cost effective manner, if at all. If we are required to change third party manufacturers, our ability to meet our scheduled hardware systems products deliveries to our customers could be adversely affected, which could cause the loss of sales and existing or potential customers, delayed revenue recognition or an increase in our hardware systems products expenses, all of which could adversely affect the margins of our hardware business. 

We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights. We rely on copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, controls and contractual commitments to protect our intellectual property rights. Despite our efforts, these protections may be limited. Unauthorized third parties may try to copy or reverse engineer portions of our products or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property. Any patents owned by us may be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. Any of our pending or future patent applications, whether or not being currently challenged, may not be issued with the scope of the claims we seek, if at all. In addition, the laws of some countries do not provide the same level of protection of our intellectual property rights as do the laws and courts of the United States. If we cannot protect our intellectual property rights against unauthorized copying or use, or other misappropriation, we may not remain competitive. 

Third parties have claimed and, in the future, may claim infringement or misuse of intellectual property rights and/or breach of license agreement provisions. We periodically receive notices from, or have lawsuits filed against us by, others claiming infringement or other misuse of their intellectual property rights and/or breach of our agreements with them. We expect the number of such claims will increase as: 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; we continue to acquire companies and expand into new businesses; 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; the number of products and competitors in our industry segments grows; 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; the use and support of third party code (including open source code) becomes more prevalent in the industry; and 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; the volume of issued patents continues to increase. 

##TABLE_END Responding to any such claim, regardless of its validity, could: 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; be time consuming, costly and result in litigation; 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; divert management&#146;s time and attention from developing our business; 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; require us to pay monetary damages or enter into royalty and licensing agreements that we would not normally find acceptable; 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; require us to stop selling or to redesign certain of our products; 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; require us to release source code to third parties, possibly under open source license terms; 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; require us to satisfy indemnification obligations to our customers; or 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. 

##TABLE_END Certain specific patent infringement cases are discussed under Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

We may lose key employees or may be unable to hire enough qualified employees. We rely on the continued service of our senior management, including our Chief Executive Officer and founder, members of our executive team and other key employees and the hiring of new qualified employees. In the technology industry, there is substantial and continuous competition for highly skilled business, product development, technical and other personnel. In addition, acquisitions could cause us to lose key personnel of the acquired companies or at Oracle. We may also experience increased compensation costs that are not offset by either improved productivity or higher sales. We may not be successful in recruiting new personnel and in retaining and motivating existing personnel. With rare exceptions, we do not have long-term employment or non-competition agreements with our employees. Members of our senior management team have left Oracle over the years for a variety of reasons, and we cannot assure you that there will not be additional departures, which may be disruptive to our operations. 

&#160; 

We continually focus on improving our cost structure by hiring personnel in countries where advanced technical expertise is available at lower costs. When we make adjustments to our workforce, we may incur expenses associated with workforce reductions that delay the benefit of a more efficient workforce structure. We may also experience increased competition for employees in these countries as the trend toward globalization continues, which may affect our employee retention efforts and increase our expenses in an effort to offer a competitive compensation program. Our compensation program includes stock options, which are an important tool in attracting and retaining employees in our industry. If our stock price performs poorly, it may adversely affect our ability to retain or attract employees. In addition, because we expense all stock-based compensation, we may in the future change our stock-based and other compensation practices. Some of the changes we consider from time to time include a reduction in the number of employees granted options, a reduction in the number of options granted per employee and a change to alternative forms of stock-based compensation. Any changes in our compensation practices or changes made by competitors could affect our ability to retain and motivate existing personnel and recruit new personnel. 

Our sales to government clients subject us to risks including early termination, audits, investigations, sanctions and penalties. We derive revenues from contracts with the U.S. government, state and local governments and their respective agencies, which may terminate most of these contracts at any time, without cause. There is increased pressure for governments and their agencies, both domestically and internationally, to reduce spending. Our federal government contracts are subject to the approval of appropriations being made by the U.S. Congress to fund the expenditures under these contracts. Similarly, our contracts at the state and local levels are subject to government funding authorizations. Additionally, government contracts are generally subject to audits and investigations which could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, refund of a portion of fees received, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business. 

We may need to change our pricing models to compete successfully. The intense competition we face in the sales of our products and services and general economic and business conditions can put pressure on us to change our prices. If our competitors offer deep discounts on certain products or services or develop products that the marketplace considers more valuable, we may need to lower prices or offer other favorable terms in order to compete successfully. Any such changes may reduce margins and could adversely affect operating results. Our software license updates and product support fees and hardware systems support fees are generally priced as a percentage of our net new software license fees and net new hardware systems products fees, respectively. Our competitors may offer lower pricing on their support offerings, which could put pressure on us to further discount our new license prices. 

Any broad-based change to our prices and pricing policies could cause our revenues to decline or be delayed as our sales force implements and our customers adjust to the new pricing policies. Some of our competitors may bundle products for promotional purposes or as a long-term pricing strategy or provide guarantees of prices and product implementations. These practices could, over time, significantly constrain the prices that we can charge for certain of our products. If we do not adapt our pricing models to reflect changes in customer use of our products or changes in customer demand, our revenues could decrease. Additionally, increased distribution of applications through application service providers, including SaaS providers, may reduce the average price for our products or adversely affect other sales of our products, reducing our revenues unless we can offset price reductions with volume increases. The increase in open source software distribution may also cause us to change our pricing models. 

Our periodic workforce restructurings can be disruptive. We have in the past restructured or made other adjustments to our workforce, including our direct sales force on which we rely heavily, in response to management changes, product changes, performance issues, acquisitions and other internal and external considerations. In the past, sales force and other restructurings have generally resulted in a temporary lack of focus and reduced productivity. These effects could recur in connection with future acquisitions and other restructurings and our revenues could be negatively affected. 

We might experience significant errors or security flaws in our software products and services. Despite testing prior to their release, software products frequently contain errors or security flaws, especially when first introduced or when new versions are released. The detection and correction of any security flaws can be time 

&#160; 

consuming and costly. Errors in our software products could affect the ability of our products to work with other hardware or software products, could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products and could adversely affect market acceptance of our products. If we experience errors or delays in releasing new software products or new versions of software products, we could lose revenues. In addition, we run our own business operations, Oracle Cloud Services and other outsourcing services, support and consulting services, on our products and networks and any security flaws, if exploited, could affect our ability to conduct our business operations. End users, who rely on our software products and services for applications that are critical to their businesses, may have a greater sensitivity to product errors and security vulnerabilities than customers for software products generally. Software product errors and security flaws in our products or services could expose us to product liability, performance and/or warranty claims as well as harm our reputation, which could impact our future sales of products and services. In addition, we may be legally required to publicly report security breaches of our services, which could adversely impact future business prospects for those services. 

We may not receive significant revenues from our current research and development efforts for several years, if at all. Developing software and hardware products is expensive, and the investment in product development often involves a long return on investment cycle. We have made and expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development and related product opportunities. Accelerated product introductions and short product life cycles require high levels of expenditures for research and development that could adversely affect our operating results if not offset by revenue increases. We believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position. However, we do not expect to receive significant revenues from these investments for several years, if at all. 

We may face numerous risks in connection with our strategic alliance with Fujitsu. Oracle has had a relationship with Fujitsu for many years. We have recently renegotiated a number of agreements with Fujitsu Limited with respect to collaborative sales and marketing efforts and the joint development and manufacturing of some of our server products. The agreements contemplate that Oracle and Fujitsu dedicate substantial financial and human resources and, as a result, the future performance of our hardware systems business may be impacted by the success or failure of this relationship. 

If we fail to satisfy certain development or supply obligations under the agreements, or if we otherwise violate the terms of the agreements, we may be subject to contractual or legal penalties. Further, if Fujitsu encounters potential problems in its business, such as intellectual property infringement claims, supply and manufacturing difficulties, including difficulties that may result from the recent earthquake and tsunami in Japan, difficulties in meeting development milestones or financial challenges, these problems could impact our strategic relationship with Fujitsu and could result in a material adverse effect on our hardware systems business. There can be no assurance that our strategic relationship with Fujitsu will be successful, or that the economic terms of the agreements establishing the relationship will ultimately prove to be favorable to us. The occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our hardware systems business. 

Business disruptions could affect our operating results. A significant portion of our research and development activities and certain other critical business operations are concentrated in a few geographic areas. We are a highly automated business and a disruption or failure of our systems could cause delays in completing sales and providing services, including some of our Cloud Services offerings. A major earthquake, fire or other catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our future operating results could be materially and adversely affected. 

There are risks associated with our outstanding and future indebtedness. As of May 31, 2011, we had an aggregate of $15.9 billion of outstanding indebtedness that will mature between the remainder of calendar 2011 and calendar 2040, and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our ability to pay interest and repay the principal for our indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations, generate sufficient cash flows to service such debt and the other factors discussed in this section. There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks successfully. 

&#160; 

We may also need to refinance a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures. There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of our existing debt. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase. Should we incur future increases in interest expense, our ability to utilize certain of our foreign tax credits to reduce our U.S. federal income tax could be limited, which could unfavorably affect our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate. In addition, changes by any rating agency to our outlook or credit rating could negatively affect the value of both our debt and equity securities and increase the interest amounts we pay on outstanding or future debt. These risks could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 

Adverse litigation results could affect our business. We are subject to various legal proceedings. Litigation can be lengthy, expensive and disruptive to our operations, and results cannot be predicted with certainty. An adverse decision could result in monetary damages or injunctive relief that could affect our business, operating results or financial condition. Additional information regarding certain of the lawsuits we are involved in is discussed under Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities. As a multinational corporation, we are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities and those authorities very often do not agree with positions taken by us on our tax returns. 

Changes in tax laws or tax rulings may have a significantly adverse impact on our effective tax rate. For example, certain U.S. government proposals for fundamental U.S. international tax reform, if enacted, could have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate. Further, in the ordinary course of a global business, there are many intercompany transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our intercompany transfer pricing is currently being reviewed by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and by foreign tax jurisdictions and will likely be subject to additional audits in the future. We have negotiated certain unilateral Advance Pricing Agreements with the IRS and certain selected bilateral Advance Pricing Agreements that cover many of our intercompany transfer pricing issues and preclude the relevant tax authorities from making a transfer pricing adjustment within the scope of these agreements. However, these agreements do not cover substantial elements of our transfer pricing. 

We are also subject to non-income based taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net worth, property and goods and services taxes, in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities with respect to these non-income based taxes and may have exposure to additional non-income based tax liabilities. Our acquisition activities have increased our non-income based tax exposures, particularly with our 2010 entry into a new hardware systems business resulting from our acquisition of Sun, which increased the volume and complexity of laws and regulations that we are subject to and with which we must comply. 

Although we believe that our income and non-income based tax estimates are reasonable, there is no assurance that the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. 

Our Oracle Cloud Services offerings, including Oracle CRM On Demand, may not be successful. We offer Oracle Cloud Services, which was formerly known as Oracle On Demand, and which include outsourcing software and hardware management and maintenance services delivered at our data center facilities, select partner data centers or customer facilities. Our Cloud Services also include certain subscription-based software offerings such as Oracle CRM On Demand, which provides our customers with our CRM software functionality delivered via a hosted solution that we manage, among others. These business models continue to evolve, and we may not be able to compete effectively, generate significant revenues or maintain their profitability. We incur expenses associated with the infrastructures and marketing of our Cloud Services in advance of our ability to recognize the revenues associated with these offerings. Our Cloud Services offerings are subject to a variety of additional risks, including: 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; we manage critical customer applications, data and other confidential information through Oracle Cloud Services; accordingly, we face increased exposure to significant damage claims and risk to

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; the laws and regulations applicable to hosted service providers are unsettled, particularly in the areas of privacy and security and use of global resources; changes in these laws could affect our ability to provide services from or to some locations and could increase both the costs and risks associated with providing the services; 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; demand for these services may not meet our expectations and may be affected by customer and media concerns about security risks, international transfers of data, government or other third party access to data, and/or use of outsourced services providers more generally; and 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; our offerings may require large fixed costs for data centers, computers, network infrastructure, security and otherwise, and we may not be able to generate sufficient revenues to offset these costs and generate acceptable operating margins from these offerings. 

##TABLE_END Charges to earnings resulting from acquisitions may adversely affect our operating results. Under business combination accounting standards pursuant to ASC 805, Business Combinations , we recognize the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interests in acquired companies generally at their acquisition date fair values and, in each case, separately from goodwill. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess amount of consideration transferred, which is also generally measured at fair value, and the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain. After we complete an acquisition, the following factors could result in material charges and adversely affect our operating results and may adversely affect our cash flows: 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; costs incurred to combine the operations of companies we acquire, such as transitional employee expenses and employee retention, redeployment or relocation expenses; 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; impairment of goodwill or intangible assets;

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; a reduction in the useful lives of intangible assets acquired; 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; identification of or changes to assumed contingent liabilities, both income tax and non-income tax related, after our final determination of the amounts for these contingencies or the conclusion of the measurement period (generally up to one year from the acquisition date), whichever comes first; 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; charges to our operating results to eliminate certain duplicative pre-merger activities, to restructure our operations or to reduce our cost structure; 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; charges to our operating results resulting from expenses incurred to effect the acquisition; and 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; charges to our operating results due to the expensing of certain stock awards assumed in an acquisition. 

##TABLE_END Substantially all of these costs will be accounted for as expenses that will decrease our net income and earnings per share for the periods in which those costs are incurred. Charges to our operating results in any given period could differ substantially from other periods based on the timing and size of our future acquisitions and the extent of integration activities. A more detailed discussion of our accounting for these and other items is presented in the &#147;Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates&#148; section of Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Item 7). 

Environmental laws and regulations subject us to a number of risks and could result in significant liabilities and costs. Some of our hardware systems operations are subject to state, federal and international laws governing protection of the environment, proper handling and disposal of materials used to manufacture our products, human health and safety, and regulating the use of certain chemical substances. We endeavor to comply 

&#160; 

with these environmental laws, yet compliance with such laws could increase our product design, development, procurement and manufacturing costs, limit our ability to manage excess and obsolete non-compliant inventory, change our sales activities, or otherwise impact future financial results of our hardware systems business. Any violation of these laws can subject us to significant liability, including fines, penalties, and possible prohibition of sales of our products into one or more states or countries, and result in a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of our hardware systems business. A significant portion of our hardware systems revenues come from international sales. Environmental legislation within the European Union (EU), including the EU Directive on Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) and Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE Directive), as well as China&#146;s regulation on Management Methods for Controlling Pollution Caused by Electronic Information Products may increase our cost of doing business internationally and impact our hardware systems revenues from EU countries and China as we endeavor to comply with and implement these requirements. In addition, similar environmental legislation has been or may be enacted in other jurisdictions, the cumulative impact of which could be significant. 

Our stock price could become more volatile and your investment could lose value. All of the factors discussed in this section could affect our stock price. The timing of announcements in the public market regarding new products, product enhancements or technological advances by our competitors or us, and any announcements by us of acquisitions, major transactions, or management changes could also affect our stock price. Changes in the amounts and frequency of share repurchases or dividends could adversely affect our stock price. Our stock price is subject to speculation in the press and the analyst community, changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by financial analysts, changes in investors&#146; or analysts&#146; valuation measures for our stock, our credit ratings and market trends unrelated to our performance. A significant drop in our stock price could also expose us to the risk of securities class actions lawsuits, which could result in substantial costs and divert management&#146;s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business. 

&#160;

##TABLE_START "
7A," Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

Cash, Cash Equivalents, Marketable Securities and Interest Income Risk 

Our bank deposits and money market investments are generally held with a number of large, diverse financial institutions worldwide which we believe mitigates certain risks. In addition, we purchase high quality debt security investments, substantially all with relatively short maturities (see a description of our debt securities held in Notes 3 and 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and &#147;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#148; above). Therefore, interest rate movements generally do not materially affect the valuation of our debt security investments. Substantially all of our marketable securities are designated as available-for-sale. We generally do not use our investments for trading purposes. 

&#160; 

Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest income that is generated from our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. For fiscal 2011, total interest income was $163 million with our investments yielding an average 0.62% on a worldwide basis. The table below presents the fair value of our cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities and the related weighted average interest rates for our investment portfolio at May 31, 2011 and 2010. 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; May 31, &#160; &#160; &#160; 2011 &#160; &#160; 2010 &#160; (Dollars in millions)

Our total borrowings were $15.9 billion as of May 31, 2011, primarily all of which were fixed rate borrowings. Future changes in interest rates and resulting changes in estimated fair values of our borrowings other than our senior notes due July 2014 (2014 Notes) and short-term borrowings pursuant to our 2011 Credit Agreements would not impact the interest expense we recognize in our consolidated statements of operations. We have entered into certain fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements to manage the interest rate and related fair value of our 2014 Notes so that the interest payable on the 2014 Notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR. We do not use these interest rate swap arrangements or our fixed rate borrowings for trading purposes. We have designated these swap agreements as qualifying instruments and are accounting for them as fair value hedges pursuant to ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging . These transactions are characterized as fair value hedges for financial accounting purposes because they protect us against changes in the fair values of our 2014 Notes due to interest rate movements. The changes in fair values of these interest rate swap agreements will be recognized as interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations with the corresponding amounts included in other assets or other non-current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. The amount of net gain (loss) attributable to the risk being hedged is recognized as interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations with the corresponding amount included in notes payable and other non-current borrowings. The periodic interest settlements, which occur at the same intervals as the 2014 Notes, are recorded as interest expense. 

By entering into these interest rate swap arrangements, we have assumed risks associated with variable interest rates based upon LIBOR. Our 2014 Notes had an effective interest rate of 1.38% as of May 31, 2011, after considering the effects of the aforementioned interest rate swap arrangements. Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest expense that we recognize in our statements of operations. An interest rate risk sensitivity analysis is used to measure interest rate risk by computing estimated changes in cash flows as a result of assumed changes in market interest rates. As of May 31, 2011, if LIBOR-based interest rates increased by 100 basis points, the change would increase our interest expense annually by approximately $15 million as it relates to our fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements. 

Foreign Currency Risk 

Foreign Currency Transaction Risk 

We transact business in various foreign currencies and are subject to risks associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures. We have a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset these risks. We may suspend this program from time to time and did so during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 until resuming the program in the second quarter of fiscal 2011. We enter into foreign currency forward contracts so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts in order to mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign 

&#160; 

currency transactions. Our foreign currency exposures typically arise from intercompany sublicense fees and other intercompany transactions that are expected to be cash settled in the near term. Our foreign currency forward contracts are generally short-term in duration. 

We neither use these foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes nor do we designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to ASC 815. Accordingly, we record the fair values of these contracts as of the end of our reporting period to our consolidated balance sheet with changes in fair values recorded to our consolidated statement of operations. The balance sheet classification for the fair values of these forward contracts is prepaid expenses and other current assets for unrealized gains and other current liabilities for unrealized losses. The statement of operations classification of gains or losses upon changes in fair values or cash settlement of these forward contracts is non-operating income (expense), net. 

Although we have resumed our foreign currency forward contract program, we expect that we will continue to realize gains or losses with respect to our foreign currency exposures, net of gains or losses from our foreign currency forward contracts. Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency exposures will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency transactions that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, the net realized gain or loss on our foreign currency forward contracts and other factors. As of May 31, 2011, the notional amounts of the forward contracts we held to purchase U.S. Dollars in exchange for other major international currencies were $2.5 billion and the notional amounts of forward contracts we held to sell U.S. Dollars in exchange for other major international currencies were $1.6 billion. The net unrealized gains of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts were nominal at May 31, 2011. As of May 31, 2010, we had a nominal amount of foreign currency forward contracts outstanding. Net foreign exchange transaction gains (losses) included in non-operating income (expense), net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations were $11 million, $(149) million and $(65) million in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Included in the net foreign exchange transaction losses for fiscal 2010 were foreign currency losses relating to our Venezuelan subsidiary&#146;s operations, which are more thoroughly described under &#147;Non-Operating Income (Expense), net&#148; in Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations above. As a large portion of our consolidated operations are international, we could experience additional foreign currency volatility in the future, the amounts and timing of which may vary. 

Foreign Currency Translation Risk 

Fluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets and liabilities that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into U.S. Dollars. In particular, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we report in U.S. Dollars for a significant portion of the cash held by these subsidiaries is subject to translation variance caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period (the offset to which is recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheet). Periodically, we may hedge net assets of certain international subsidiaries from foreign currency exposure. 

&#160; 

As the U.S. Dollar fluctuated against certain international currencies as of the end of fiscal 2011, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we reported in U.S. Dollars for these subsidiaries as of May 31, 2011 increased relative to what we would have reported using a constant currency rate as of May 31, 2010. As reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows, the estimated effect of exchange rate changes on our reported cash and cash equivalents balances in U.S. Dollars for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 was an increase (decrease) of $600 million, $(107) million and $(501) million, respectively. The following table includes the U.S. Dollar equivalent of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities denominated in certain major foreign currencies as of May 31, 2011:
